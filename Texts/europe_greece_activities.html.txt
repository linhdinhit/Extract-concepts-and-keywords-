 Activities  Greece's mountainous terrain is perfect for trekking. The countryside is crisscrossed with donkey and goat tracks, and Byzantine cobbled paths link most villages. Although some of the alpine trails are a tad overgrown, most of the popular routes are well maintained. The forested Pindos mountains of Epiros, the Peloponnese and the southwest of Crete are the among the best areas for trekking. Still on terra firma, Greece is one of the cheapest places in Europe to go skiing and has around 20 resorts which provide a pleasant alternative to the glitz of the Alps. The most developed resort is on Mt Parnassos near Delphi.  The meltemi and the lakelike surface of the Aegean provide perfect conditions for windsurfing, which is the most popular water sport in Greece. Hrysi Akti on Paros and Vasiliki on Lefkada are the top spots. Although snorkelling is encouraged and well worthwhile anywhere along the coast, Monastiri on Paros, Telendos Islet near Kalymnos and anywhere off the coast of Kastellorizo are especially good places. Scuba diving is strictly forbidden, unless under the auspices of a diving school, so that underwater antiquities are protected from pilferers. Water skiing can be done on Chios, Corfu, Crete, Kythira, Lesvos, Paros, Skiathos and Rhodes.
