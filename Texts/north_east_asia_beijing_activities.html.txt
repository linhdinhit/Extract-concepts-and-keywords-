 Activities  To paraphrase an old adage, 'when in Beijing do as the Beijingers do' - bike it. A blockbuster bike tour allows you to experience the city as its residents do and gives you access to the narrow, spidery hutongs. In winter there are heaps of ice-skating venues around the city, including Beihai Lake, Kunming Lake, Zizhuyan Park and the moat around the Forbidden City. Flying kites is an old tradition in China and Beijing's venue for this activity is Tiananmen Square. Kites are for rent in the square itself.  Also worth checking out is the Yuanmingyuan Ruyi Martial Arts School opposite the Summer Palace, where you can study  gongfu (kungfu) and  qigong.  As well, a whiff of the tourist dollar has sent Chinese entrepreneurs scrambling up the rock face of the adventure sport economy. In and around Beijing there's a mushrooming choice: paragliding, hang-gliding, rock climbing, diving with sharks, skiing (Hebei's ski resorts are within reach), bungee jumping, horseback riding and more.
