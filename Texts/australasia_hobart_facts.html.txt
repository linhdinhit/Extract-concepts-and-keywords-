 When to Go  Hobart is most popular in summer (December to February) when it's warm enough for swimming and great to be outdoors. Accommodation is heavily booked and restaurants are crowded, but it's also when you'll see the big events, such as the Sydney to Hobart yacht race. Winter (June to August) is often cold, wet and cloudy; spring (September to November) can be very windy and the hills around Hobart may still get snow. Autumn, from March to May, is mild and there are plenty of festivals.     Events  The New Year arrival of the yachts competing in the Sydney to Hobart and Melbourne to Hobart yacht races is the apex of the Hobart Summer Festival, held from late December to late January. The Royal Hobart Regatta in February is the largest boating carnival in the southern hemisphere. In March, sharpen your quill for the Salamanca Writers' Weekend. The Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Show is in October.
