 Attractions  This museum, which has a huge whale skeleton in the front window, is one of Adelaide's landmarks. Although its primarily a natural history museum, with the usual array of stuffed, glassy-eyed critters, it also has a good collection of Aboriginal artefacts, including an Aboriginal Dreamtime exhibition. You'll find the museum on North Terrace.  Other museums nearby include the excellent Migration Museum, which tells the story of groups from over 100 nationalities who've migrated to South Australia, and the University's Museum of Classical Archaeology, which has a fascinating collection of antiquities dating from the third millennium BC.
