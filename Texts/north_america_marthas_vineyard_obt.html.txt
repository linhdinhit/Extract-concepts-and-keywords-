 Off the Beaten Track  A tiny island, Chappaquiddick, or Chappy, is an adored part of Martha's Vineyard, probably because visitors, especially day-trippers, mostly overlook it. There are very few houses on the island, no shops or eateries and little to do except appreciate the natural beauty and pristine beaches. The main attractions are the 500acre (202ha) Cape Pogue Wildlife Refuge, (complete with a remote lighthouse), and the 200acre (81ha) Wasque Reservation, both unspoiled and unfrequented stretches of sand. Naturalist-led expeditions of Cape Pogue and its lighthouse are available from the Trustees of the Reservations. In addition to its beautiful open space, the island contains the meditative 14acre (5.6ha) Mytoi Japanese garden.  Chappaquiddick is also widely and infamously known for the tragic incident that involved US Senator Edward Kennedy in 1969, when a passenger in the car he was driving died as the car plunged off a small wooden bridge. This narrow spit of land is within 200yd (183m) of Edgartown, and can only be reached via a five-minute car/bike/passenger ferry from Edgartown center. The ferry leaves whenever there are people who want to go; that way, it's always 'on time'.
