 Off the Beaten Track  Feldkirch is the gateway to Liechtenstein from the Austrian side of the border, and the town still retains some medieval buildings. There are good views from the 12th-century Schattenburg Castle, which houses a museum. There's also a free animal park about 1km (0.6mi) from the centre of town. Feldkirch hosts the important Schubertiade music festival in late June, and if you're there in winter it's worth having a crack at the ski slopes. You can reach Feldkirch by bus or train from Vaduz.
