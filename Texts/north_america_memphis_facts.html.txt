 When to Go  The best times to visit Memphis are the temperate seasons of spring and autumn; these are also the most scenic seasons. Spring is lush with fresh blooms and high rivers, and colorful autumn foliage covers upland woodlands in October. Many Memphis special events are held during these seasons, including the Beale St Music Festival (mid-May), the Spring Powwow (late May or early June) and the International Blues Talent Competition (October).     Events  By city proclamation, the King's birthday (January 8) is Elvis Presley Day, and Graceland is the center of festivities. On or around January 15 (usually the third Monday), Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday is celebrated with a national holiday and a city tribute. Beale St's Zydeco Festival and ethnic activities coincide with Black History Month through February. The anniversary of Martin Luther King's death is marked with a Memorial March on April 4. Memphis in May is the major citywide festival; held mid-month, it includes a barbecue cook-off and the Beale St Music Festival. On Mother's Day weekend (late May or early June), the Spring Powwow is held at Chucalissa. Also in June, the Center for Southern Folklore hosts the Memphis Music and Heritage Festival, a major cultural event with fabulous roots music. It runs for three days and is usually held the second weekend of the month.  The August 15 anniversary of the death of Elvis sparks city-wide events, including a candlelight vigil at Graceland and a Dead Elvis Ball at the P&H Cafe. In October, the International Blues Talent Competition highlights new talent on Beale St. The WC Handy Birthday Celebration in mid-November pays tribute to the original Beale St bluesman. New Year's Eve turns Beale St into a giant street party.
