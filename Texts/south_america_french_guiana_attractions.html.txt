 Attractions  French Guiana's capital has a relaxed tropical ambiance. It's located at the western end of a small, hilly peninsula between the Cayenne and Mahury rivers on the Atlantic coast and is the country's major port. The liveliest area is the Place de Palmistes at the northwest end of town, where there are many cafes and outdoor food stalls; the oldest area is the Place Grenoble, to the west, which is home to most of the town's public buildings. Avenue du General de Gaulle is the main commercial street.  The remains of the 17th-century Fort Ceperou may not look like much, but the views of the town, the port and the Cayenne River make a visit worthwhile. The Musee Departemental has interesting exhibits on indigenous peoples, colonial history and the penal colony. Cayenne's main vegetable market is on Place Victor Schoelcher, named after the man most responsible for ending slavery in French Guiana. The misleadingly named Village Chinois (Chinatown) has a fish market and Asian (mainly Javanese) food stalls. Some of the best music is in small clubs in Village Chinois, nicknamed 'Chicago.' Cayenne's best beach is at Remire-Montjoly, 10km (6mi) southeast of town, where you'll also find the historical ruins of Fort Diamant and an early colonial sugar mill.
