 Activities  For those on a short visit, a 2-1/2-hour island-wide organized bus tour takes in all the major towns, stops for 30 minutes at Aquinnah, and provides a good overview of the island. Organized boat tours are also available, from a small 50-foot wooden sloop to larger vessels.   Cycling is a perfect way to explore the island and bicycles and mopeds can be rented in the main towns. The dense 4400 acre (1760ha) Manuel F Correllus State Forest occupies a huge chunk of the island's mid-section and has plenty of walking and biking trails. Other places to hike or bike include Cedar Tree Neck Sanctuary, West Tisbury and the 600 acre (240ha) Long Point Wildlife Refuge which also has a few short trails and bird watching possibilities.  Water-based activities are a cinch to come by including good old-fashioned beach swimming, kayaking, windsurfing, sailing, water-skiing, wakeboarding, kneeboarding, parasailing, jet-skiing and inner-tubing.   Sailing and fishing charters can be arranged, horseback ridingis popular and for those who need to whack a ball, golfing and tennis are within striking distance.
