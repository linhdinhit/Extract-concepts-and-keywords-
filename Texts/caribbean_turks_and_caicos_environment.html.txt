 Environment  Much of the Turks and Caicos islands, most notably the southern halves of North, Middle and East Caicos, are comparatively lush landscapes watered by creeks, as well as sand flats, lagoons and marshy wetlands. Most of the sandy beaches are found on the north and west shores, facing the open ocean. Like the Bahamian archipelago, the two island groups each sit atop a flat underwater mountain surrounded by its own barrier reef.  The Turks and Caicos' climate is similar to that of the southern Bahamas, though slightly warmer and drier. Temperatures average 77 F (25 C) in winter and rise to an average of 90 F (32 C) in summer. Average annual rainfall is 21in (53cm). Most of the rain falls in summer.
