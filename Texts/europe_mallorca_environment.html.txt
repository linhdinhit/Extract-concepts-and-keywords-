 Environment  The Balearic Islands sit in the Mediterranean sea just off the northeast coast of mainland Spain; floating in between Menorca and Ibiza, Mallorca is the largest. The capital, Palma de Mallorca, is surrounded by rocky inlets and harbours on the southern side, while most of the high-rise tourist resorts line the east coast. Sa Dragonera is the large, uninhabited island off the island's westernmost point. The northwest is defined by the dramatic Serra de Tramuntana mountain range and Mallorca's highest peak, Puig Major (1445m/4740ft). The northeast coast is made up of two sweeping bays: the Badia de Pollen a and the larger Badia d'Alc dia. The fertile plain known as Es Pla makes up a large part of inland Mallorca.  Mallorca's flora and fauna is rich. Trees such as the Aleppo pine, the evergreen holm oak and the carob tree are common, while the dwarf palm mainly grows around Pollen a, Alc dia and Andratx. Attractive orange and lemon orchards grow around S ller. The tree heather and wild flowers (hyacinths, violets, gladioli, etc) are also stunning. Reptiles (snake and gecko), mountain goats, wild sheep, rabbits and toads are all residents on the island. Birds of prey, including ospreys, kestrels and the rare black vulture, inhabit the mountainous northwest, and migratory birds flock to the marshes in summer. The Parc Natural de l'Albufera and Cabrera Island are both protected areas.  The Mediterranean climate of the Balearics keeps Mallorca's winter comfortably mild (around 15 C/59 F). Summer temperatures of around 27 C (85 F) are perfect for swimming (the water is also warm) and other outdoor activities.
