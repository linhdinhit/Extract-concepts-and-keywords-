 Off the Beaten Track  West of the center, Seurasaari Island provides a charming glimpse of Finland past. The open-air museum recreates a rural village, complete with 18th- and 19th-century houses taken from around the country. Guides dressed in traditional costume demonstrate crafts such as spinning, embroidery and troll-making. Shops sell old-fashioned treats, and folk-dancing performances are scheduled frequently during the summer. Midsummer Eve is especially festive - a huge bonfire kicks off the celebrations, and a real wedding takes place in the Karuna Church.  The park opened in the late 19th century, when it was only accessible by boat. It's been popular with locals and visitors ever since. The buildings are closed during the winter, but the park is open for cross-country skiing and invigorating walks.
