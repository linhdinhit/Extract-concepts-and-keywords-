 Off the Beaten Track  From November to February, world-famously huge waves - some in the legendary order of 50ft (15m) high - break along Oahu's relatively untrammeled north shore, where they're greeted by an enthusiastic community of surfing dudes and dudettes, and just as enthusiastic onlookers. Sunset Beach is one of the three prime surfing locations in the area - the others are the Banzai Pipeline off Ehukai Beach, and Waimea. The challenging breaks at Sunset Beach play a key role in the annual Triple Crown of Surfing, one of the most hotly contested and lucrative events on the competitive surfing calendar. The big surf break called Backyards, at the northern end of the beach, is also popular with windsurfers.  Though the size of its waves lend it a fearsome reputation, Sunset Beach is a pretty low-key place when not packed to the dunes with surfies, and the surrounding area offers some decent swimming and snorkeling over summer when the swells and rips die down a bit. Every weekend in the peak surf season, convoys of spectators motor up to the north shore from Honolulu - if you're there in winter, it's best to visit on a weekday.
