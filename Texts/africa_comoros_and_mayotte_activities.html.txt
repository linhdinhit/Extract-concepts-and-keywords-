 Activities   Diving is being heavily promoted on Comoros but the sites don't quite match up to those on the Seychelles or Mauritius. Currently there is only one diving school operating. Mayotte's older and more developed coral reefs make it a popular diving spot for tourists and locals alike. Big-game fishing is possible, but expensive, and pretty much the sole preserve of the wealthy island-hoppers and their very tanned friends. Expeditions can be arranged through the same company that organises diving tours.  For those of you with little money, but strong legs, hiking is a great way to see the islands and get a better feel for the rhythms of islander life. The hikes are not particularly arduous (with the exception of the hike up Mt Karthala), and there are a multitude of scenic treks to pick from. Quite a number of routes will take you past majestic waterfalls, through rainforests, or onto beautiful deserted beaches. There are some fine swimming beaches at Itsandra and Ngwala on Grand Comore but the hotels have commandeered these, and it will cost you an arm and a leg to swim there. You'll fare better on the islands of Anjouan and Moheli where the beaches are free and plentiful.
