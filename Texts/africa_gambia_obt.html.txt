 Off the Beaten Track  Basse Santa Su - more commonly referred to as Basse - is Gambia's easternmost town and the largest and liveliest of the upriver settlements. It's also the last major ferry-crossing point and a transport hub for the surrounding area. The most interesting sections of town are the waterfront and the market, the latter especially on Thursday, when the streets are lined with shops and stalls. The whole place comes alive nightly when the town's drink stalls open and grilled-meat shacks fire up.  Down by the waterfront, an colonial warehouse dating from 1916 has been converted into a museum, cultural centre, bookshop and restaurant called Traditions. There's a fair amount of high-quality stuff on offer, as well as glimpses of the artists and artisans at work. If the shopping bug really has you itching, several of Basse's surrounding villages host a weekly lumo (market), where traders and shoppers come from all over Gambia as well as from nearby countries to participate in the events.
