The end of July is probably the best time as you'll catch the lavsøka festivities.     Events  Counting Christmas, New Year and Easter, the Faroes have no fewer than 20 public holidays, ranging from the religious to Labour Day. The Faroese National Day is  lavsøka, celebrated on 28 and 29 July, when the normally reserved Faroese really cut loose with drinking binges and rowdy behaviour. The festival is named in honour of St Olav, who pressed for acceptance of Christianity in Scandinavia, however it probably dates back to pagan times and adopted St Olav's name as a convenient way of lending it Christian sanction. Highlights include a rowing competition in which villages compete against each other, horse races, art exhibitions, chain dances and religious services. In mid-July, the western Faroes host the annual two-day Vestanstevna, which follow more or less the same agenda as the lavsøka.
