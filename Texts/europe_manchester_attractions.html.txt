 Attractions  Albert Square is smack bang in the city's heart, cushioned between Deansgate and Mosley St and named for its memorial to Victoria's beloved husband. The square is dominated by the sensationally Victorian Gothic town hall, designed by Alfred Waterhouse, the architect responsible for London's equally neo-Gothic Natural History Museum. St Peter's Square is just to the south, with its circular library and, marking the spot of the Peterloo massacre in 1819, the Free Trade Hall (recently sold off as a hotel). The city's former central railway station looms further south, now transformed into the G-Mex Exhibition & Event Centre and overlooked by the postmod angularity of the Bridgewater Hall, home to the city's famed Halle Orchestra.  To the west, Deansgate features the gorgeously Vic-Gothic John Rylands Library, built on cotton wealth to the glory of a famous local manufacturer. The library's collection of early printed books includes a Gutenberg Bible, several Caxtons and manuscripts dating from 2000 BC. The Pumphouse People's History Museum, another cultural institution of note, borders the River Irwell further west, and focuses on social history and the Labour movement.
