 Activities  The Brisbane Bushwalkers Club has information on bushwalks close to Brisbane. The swimming pool at Spring Hill Baths in Torrington Square is among the oldest in the southern hemisphere and is surrounded by old-style colourfully painted changing cubicles. For those who prefer their water salty, there are plenty of swimming beaches close to Brisbane on sheltered Moreton Bay. The artificial lagoon at South Bank Parklands is great for an inner-city dip. A number of river cruises are available on the Kookaburra River Queens, restored paddle steamers which depart from Eagle St Pier. The Cliffs, on the south banks of the Brisbane River, has some good rock climbing and abseiling - the area is floodlit until midnight.
