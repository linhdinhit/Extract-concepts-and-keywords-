 Off the Beaten Track  If you want a tour with a difference, and don't mind the possibility of getting a little wet, then this may just be what you were after - riding in a brightly decorated, amphibious military landing vehicle. The tour begins in Branson in an open-air WWII vintage amphibious vehicle and guides you around the town and then straight onto neighboring Lake Taneycomo. On route you'll pass sights like Tablerock Lake Dam, the old stern-wheeled riverboat, the Branson Belle and Shepherd of the Hills Fish Hatchery. For over 25 years, the Coast Guard-licensed captains have guided visitors on these 80-minute fun and fact-filled trips around the area. So when in Branson do as the brochure says - grab your "Wacky Quacker", hop on a Duck and take to the water. Ride the Ducks are at 2320 West Hwy 76.
