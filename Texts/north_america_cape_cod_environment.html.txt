 Environment  Cape Cod sticks out of Massachusetts like a teenage boy flexing his (somewhat puny) muscles. Locals use a somewhat confusing nomenclature for the various Cape Cod districts. Cape Cod Bay laps at the shoreline's inner rim, Nantucket Sound is to the south, while the Atlantic pounds on the eastern shore.  The 'Upper Cape' is nearest the canal and the mainland. Its principal towns are Bourne, Falmouth, Mashpee and Sandwich. 'Mid-Cape' extends from Barnstable and Hyannis eastward to Orleans, including Yarmouth and Dennis. The 'Lower' (or 'Outer') Cape extends north and east from Orleans to Provincetown, including Brewster, Harwich, Chatham, Orleans, Eastham, Wellfleet, and Truro.
