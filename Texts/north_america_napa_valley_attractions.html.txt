 Attractions  Napa is the valley's financial, if not cultural, center. There are interesting old buildings in the small downtown, plus a few good restaurants. But the main reasons to stop are more practical: Napa makes a convenient center for exploration of the area's more intoxicating attractions, and a plethora of shops rent bicycles if you'd like to pedal from vineyard to vineyard (yes, California law does prohibit biking while tipsy, so be careful out there).  If you'd rather not work up a sweat while you sample, hop aboard Napa Valley Wine Train, which conducts brunch, lunch and dinner tours throughout the year in vintage Pullman dining cars traveling to St Helena and back. After your ride, check out Copia, a $50 million wine, food and cultural center that has brought a much-needed boost to Napa's downtown area. Day passes include access to the extensive organic gardens, art exhibits and wine programs. Tickets for film screenings, cooking classes, outdoor concerts and more are sold separately.
