 Activities  What can't you do in the Anchorage area? Even if this area is the most urbanized outpost in this great state, most outdoor enthusiasts would have a hard time reaching boredom. With 122mi (196km) of paved bicycle paths alongside roads and within parks, the city is prime for bicycling. The best spots include Chester Creek Trail, Tony Knowles Coastal Trail, Turnagain Arm Bike Path and Chugach State Park. Rock-climbing monkeys can explore several faces along Seward Hwy, or climb indoors at the Alaska Rock Gym on Fairbanks St. The mountainous area also offers endless hiking opportunities. Good sites include Flattop Mountain Trail, Wolverine Peak Trail, the Ramp and Williwaw Lakes Trail.  Within the city, there are companies offering walking tours and bus tours. More than a dozen charter companies in Anchorage offer flightseeing tours, an expensive but breathtaking way to peek at the region's grandeur.
