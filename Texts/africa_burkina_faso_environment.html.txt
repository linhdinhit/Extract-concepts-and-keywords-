 Environment  Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta), shaped like a pair of welder's goggles, sits at the edge of the Sahel, locked in by Benin, Togo and Ghana to the southeast, C te d'Ivoire to the south, Mali to the west and Niger to the north. At about twice the size of Colorado, it's one of the smallest territories in West Africa but one of the most heavily populated. Distribution is uneven and sketchy; large tracts of land in the north are almost deserted, while the south and central regions are bursting at the seams.  Most of Burkina is flat, arid and scrubby. To the north the vegetation thins out to sandy dunes as it approaches the Sahara. Conversely, the south opens up into forests and sugar cane fields and in the east there are rolling plateaus and green woodlands. The three major rivers of Burkina Faso, the Mahoun (Black Volta), Nazinon (Red Volta) and Nakanbe (White Volta), drain the central plateau in a southerly and easterly direction respectively.  Deforestation and desertification are a major threat to Burkina Faso, brought about through an unholy combination of drought, rapid population growth, overgrazing, and severe economic woes. The result is a 70km (43mi) swathe of land around the capital city, Ouagadougou, that's completely devoid of trees. The land has been picked clean as a bone by residents using the woods as their prime energy source. Some parks and reserves have survived this onslaught. Throughout the major national parks you can still see elephants, hippopotamuses, buffalo, antelope and crocodiles.  The climate in Burkina Faso is similar to other Sahel countries with two distinct seasons. The dry season lasts from November to May, and the wet season from June through to October. The hottest time of the year is between March and June, and dusty Harmattan winds blow incessantly between December and February, turning the landscape hazy and unphotogenic, and people sour, and irritable.
