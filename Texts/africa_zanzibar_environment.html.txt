 Environment  Tanzania is a republic in East Africa, on the Indian Ocean. The archipelago is to the east of the mainland. Zanzibar island is about the same size as London; Pemba is the second main island in the archipelago, and is similar in size to Paris (all similarities end there). Pemba is very fertile, and one of the world's leading producers of cloves. Myriad little islands surround Zanzibar and Pemba, often disappearing at high tide.  There are no national parks within the archipelago, however, wildlife such as monkeys, civet cats and mongooses are common, and birdlife is prolific. Deforestation is a major headache for the archipelago, with about 95% of the tropical forest that once covered Zanzibar and Pemba now gone. The only remaining areas of forests are at Jozani (Zanzibar), Ngezi and Msitu Mkuu (Pemba) - all of which are protected reserves - as well as some patches of primary forest on islands near Pemba. Dynamite fishing poses a serious environmental threat, although progress has been made in halting this destructive practice.  The archipelago's climate is tropical and high in sticky-shirt humidity. Avoid pulling ugly faces from December to March, when the north-east trade winds blow, and again from May to October, when the south-east trade winds rage. You can, however, make faces during the 'long rains', which fall from mid-March to May, but don't wear white T-shirts because it can rain virtually every day; the 'short rains' fall between November, December and sometimes into January.
