 Off the Beaten Track  This hill-top sanctuary, about 4km (2.4mi) from the centre of town, is visible on a clear day from most parts of Bologna. The basilica, built in the eighteenth century, is connected to the city walls by a lovely long portico, or covered walkway, made up of 666 arches (a number of some theological significance). You can take a bus from the town centre and change at Villa Spada for a minibus to the sanctuary; but when the sun is shining it's worth getting off at Meloncello and walking underneath the arches for the remaining 2km (1.2mi).
