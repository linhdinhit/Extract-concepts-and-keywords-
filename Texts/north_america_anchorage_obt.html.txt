 Off the Beaten Track  This is the spot for bush-plane spotters; Lake Hood is the world's busiest floatplane base (and ski-plane base in the winter). Just about every type of small plane imaginable can be seen jetting onto and off of the lake's surface.  If seeing live air traffic leaves you thirsty for more, check out the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum on the south shore of Lake Hood. In an effort to preserve Alaska's unique approach to aviation, the museum has films, displays on pilots, vintage aircraft and an observation deck. An afternoon swim in adjoining Spenard Lake is a nice way to end the trip.
