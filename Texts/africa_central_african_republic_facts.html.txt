 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: Only nationals of France, Germany, Israel and Switzerland do not need visas. There is a CAR embassy in Washington DC, but none in the UK and only a few in Europe. In most African countries where there's no CAR representation the French embassy can arrange CAR visas.Health risks: Malaria, bilharzia (schistosomiasis, which makes swimming unsafe everywhere), AIDS (many adults, particularly prostitutes, are affected in Bangui).Time:GMT/UTC + 1 hourElectricity: 220 voltsWeights & measures: metric When to Go  Rain is the most important point to consider when planning a trip to the CAR, because a wet season downpour can strand you for days. In most of the CAR the best time to travel is from November to April, but the rains come by late February in the south and around Bangui. Most of the national parks are open year-round, but St Floris in the northeast is open only from 1 December to 15 May.     Events  The CAR celebrates all the Christian festivals, and in the north, all the Muslim ones. Their dates vary according to the Muslim lunar calendar.  Tabaski (Id al Kabir) is also known as the Great Feast, and is the most important celebration in northern central Africa. Muslims kill a sheep to commemorate the moment when Abraham was about to sacrifice his son in obedience to God's command. (God intervened at the last moment and suggested a ram instead.) It also coincides with the end of the pilgrimage to Mecca. New Year's Day is a holiday throughout the country as well.
