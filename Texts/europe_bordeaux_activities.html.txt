 Activities  'What else is there to do in Bordeaux but drink wine?', you might ask. Well, it's true that wine tasting courses, chateau visits, wine shopping and clubbing your way through Bordeaux' vibrant nightlife are probably the Bordeaux region's number one pastime. There are, however, plenty of things to do that don't involve wine - and we don't mean cooking and language classes, though these are also on offer. We're talking physical, outdoor, smell-the-roses, sweat-out-the-alcohol activities.  France is a cyclist's dream destination, and the area around Bordeaux, particularly Arcachon, offers a wealth of easy cycling routes. If you need a little culture mixed in with your exercise, the Bordeaux tourist office offers walking tours to get your mind as well as your heart racing. The Medoc has some great beaches, and sea kayaking, windsurfing, diving and boat excursions are all possible. If naturism is your thang, Euronat, a relaxed naturist village 80km (50mi) north of Bordeaux is one of France's prime spots to get nude. (You'll need a membership card or International Naturist Federation naturist passport.)
