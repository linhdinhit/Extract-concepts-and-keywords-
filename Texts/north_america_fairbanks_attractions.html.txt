 Attractions  Even if you find theme parks a little corny, Pioneer Park (the park formerly known as Alaskaland) makes for a very enjoyable afternoon. And apart from some tours and attractions, it's free. Inside are historical displays such as the Nenana, a former stern-wheeler of the Yukon River fleet, the railroad car that carried President Warren Harding to the golden spike ceremony in 1923, the home of Judge James Wickersham and a century-old carousel that's still going round and round and round. You'll also find Gold Rush Town, a street of relocated log cabins, many converted into gift shops; the Pioneer Air Museum; and the Pioneers Museum, which depicts the settlement of Alaska.  At the back of the park, you'll find the Native Village Museum, a look at traditional Athabascan life, and the Mining Valley, which has displays of gold-mining equipment. A miniature 30-gauge train, the Crooked Creek & Whiskey Island Railroad, will take the kids around the park, and at night there is entertainment at the Palace Saloon. You'll also find one of the best salmon bakes in the state on site. A free shuttle bus, made to look like a train, makes hourly runs each day between the visitor center and major hotels to the park.
