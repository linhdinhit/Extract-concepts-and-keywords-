 Attractions  Harare, with a population of over 1.6 million, is the capital and heart of the nation in nearly every respect. The city was bequeathed a distinctly European flavour by its colonisers, and it continues as Zimbabwe's showpiece city and centre of commerce, with high-rise buildings, traffic and all their attendant bustle. Having said that, violent crime is fairly common and visitors should never walk in the city alone and should keep off the streets altogether at night unless using an official taxi.  The National Gallery of Zimbabwe is the final word on African art and material culture. Its displays range from earthy African art to colonial and post-colonial painting and sculpture. Harare Gardens, the city's largest park, has music at the bandstand on weekends, and an island-like stand of rainforest which contains a miniature model of Victoria Falls and the Zambezi Gorges. Much of Harare's activity focuses on Mbare musika, 5km (3mi) south of the centre, Zimbabwe's largest market and busiest bus terminal. The Kopje, a granite hill rising above the south-west corner of central Harare, is a great place to go for views of the city.  Central Harare is compact, making it a breeze to get around on foot. Cheaper shops and hotels and much of Harare's nightlife is concentrated just west of the trendy central shopping area. The Kopje area is the best place to look for a pungwe, an all night drinking and dancing performance by top musicians
