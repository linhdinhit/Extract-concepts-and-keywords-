 Activities  If you prefer to spend your leisure time outdoors, there are more than a few options to leave you feeling indecisive. The snug central cityscape is custom-made for walking, whether your feet carry you along the restaurant and bar-hemmed boulevards of the newer parts of the city, side-step you through the crowds trying to make their way up and down the cape's narrowest lanes, or join one of the many organised walking tours (thematic excursions range from 'Parks of the City' to the more appealing 'Vice and Drunkenness'). Those who like to watch can feast their eyes on hockey, cycling and canoeing events around the capital. Alternatively you can have your own adrenalin rush, particularly in winter when skating, snowboarding and downhill and cross-country skiing are the coolest endeavours.  Fans of the great indoors can stagger between bars on Rue St Jean, go clubbing on Grande Allee, or immerse themselves in performing arts at places like Grand The tre de Quebec (in St Jean Baptiste) or The tre de la Bordee (at the western end of Old Town).
