 Activities  If the polluted waterways in Lima itself deter you from swimming (the best beaches are found south of Lima), you can go diving. Sailboat rides to nearby islands are reasonably popular and if you've been indulging in Lima's cafe and restaurant scene a bit too much, there are tennis and golf clubs to help burn off that extra girth. If the slower paced activity of retail therapy seems more your style, then Lima has a plethora of shopping malls, boutique stores and markets just waiting to tear you from your hard earned cash.
