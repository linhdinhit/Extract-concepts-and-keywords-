 Activities   Caving, both on land and underwater, is spectacular and easily accessible. Tongatapu has one cave, Vava'u has several and 'Eua has dozens of limestone caves. Exploring underwater caves is best on Ha'apai, which has a deep cave full of flashlight fish. With water temperatures around a pleasant 23 C to 30 C (73 F to 86 F) snorkelling, surfing, swimming and diving are great in any of the major island groups. Volcanoes, shipwrecks, canyons, coral reefs, a stunning variety of reef fish and visibility that in places reaches 70m (230ft) make the snorkelling and diving spectacular, and the surfing is as good at any time of year as it gets anywhere in the world. The surf's best on Ha'apai and Vava'u, and the best surfing on Tongatapu is at Ha'atafu Beach.   Kayaking is increasing in popularity, and Tonga offers a wide scope for challenging sea kayaking. The Vava'u group offers clear, calm and sheltered waters, and the Ha'apai group has a little more open sea. The whale-watching season is from June to November on Tongatapu and Ha'apai, and July to November on Vava'u. On trips to watch whales, underwater microphones catch whale songs for you to hear. Game-fishing charters are showing up all over Tonga, and you can also indulge in the less competitive form with a good book, a deserted beach and a long line.
