 Activities  Venezuela's 40-odd national parks provide a great range of treks, from well-signposted jaunts to jungle paths that should not be attempted without a machete and some local knowledge. Parque Nacional El vila, which looms over Caracas, is probably a good place to start; head for Guatopo, Terepaima and San Esteban for less developed trails. The Sierra Nevada de Merida is the best region in the country for mountaineering, hill trekking and rock climbing; guides and equipment are available for hire. Merida is also the best place to go hang-gliding and paragliding. There are beautiful beaches and snorkeling opportunities all along the Caribbean coast. Tucacas is the best diving center. Speleologists should check out the Cueva del Gu charo, the most spectacular of Venezuela's many cave systems. It's a three-hour bus ride inland from Cuman .
