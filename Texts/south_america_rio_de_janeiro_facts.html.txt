 When to Go  Rio has a classical tropical climate, so expect some rain. Summer (December to March) is hot with top temperatures ranging from 25 C (77 F) to 40 C (104 F). It can also be dreadfully humid; there are more showers in summer than at other times, but they rarely last long. Winter temperatures range from around 20 C (68 F) to 30 C (86 F), with plenty of good beach days.  Carnaval is often a more important consideration than weather for travelers deciding when to come to Rio. The city is in full party mode, and the excitement on the streets is unsurpassable. However, everyone becomes a little unglued around the time of Carnaval - there are more car accidents than usual, prices are noticeably more expensive and you won't have a moment alone. Still, it is Carnaval.     Events  The streets of Rio go tchica-tchica-bum! when Carnaval comes to town for five heady days that begin at midnight on the Friday before Ash Wednesday. Every year, wealthy and spaced-out foreigners descend on Rio en masse to get drunk, get high, bag some sun and exchange exotic diseases. Dancing, parades, head-dresses and bare breasts are all part of the spectacle.  The four-day Carnival commences on the following dates: March 1 2003; Feb 21 2004; Feb 5 2005.  The Festas Juninas in June is one of the most important folkloric festivals in Brazil. In Rio, it's celebrated in various public squares throughout the month. Music, colorful stalls and a procession into the streets mark the Festa de NS da Gl ria do Outeiro on August 15. Every Sunday in October, the lively Festa da Penha is one of the largest religious and popular festivals in the city. Not surprisingly, the year ends with a bang on New Year's Eve & Festa de Iemanj, as millions of people celebrate while tons of fireworks explode in the glittering sky.
