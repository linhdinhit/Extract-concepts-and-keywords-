 Off the Beaten Track  The Lindt & Sprüngli chocolate factory is a few kilometers south of the city center at Seestrasse 204. There is a free museum (ask for the extensive English notes) and a rather self-congratulatory film is screened. These facilities are not always open, however, so phone ahead for their schedule. It is well worth a visit, not least for the very generous free gift of chocolate given at the end.
