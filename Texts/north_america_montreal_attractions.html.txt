 Attractions  Set up as a public market space in 1803, the Place Jacques Cartier in Montreal's romantic Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) is still the area's focal point. Filled with vendors, visitors, performers and horse-drawn carriages in the summer, it can push the point of rubbing shoulders with the locals a little too literally during the peak season. Near the austere H tel de Ville (City Hall), the Place Jacques Cartier is the perfect spot to launch a walking assault on Montreal's oldest district. Explore the park-lined Promenade de Vieux Port (Old Port) along the waterfront and the narrow, cobblestone streets around Rue St Paul with its old stone houses and buildings that now house little restaurants, galleries and clubs.  Elsewhere among the charm and character of Old Montreal is the Place d'Armes, the other major square in the area, featuring the magnificent Basilica Notre Dame. Built in 1829 and big enough to hold 5000 people, the Basilica's luscious, richly detailed interior houses the Chapelle du Sacre Couer (Sacred Heart Chapel) and still attracts legions of admirers. In the west end of Vieux Montreal is the Place Royale where Ville Marie, Montreal's first small fort town, was built. It later became a marketplace and is now the forecourt of the Veille Douane (Old Customs House), linked to the Pointe a Calliere Museum of Archaeology & History. Built on the exact spot of Montreal's first European settlement, the fascinating museum is mostly underground, in the actual ruins of buildings and an ancient sewage/river system.
