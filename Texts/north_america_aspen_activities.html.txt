 Activities  Most wintertime visitors to Aspen follow their poles straight to the slopes, for some top-of-the-line downhill and cross-country skiing. They share the area's white space with those snowboarding, snowshoeing or telemarking. When the ice melts, new possibilities rise to the surface. Aspen's trails are ideal for hiking and mountain biking, and areas like Independence Pass offer much sought-after rock-climbing. The more flighty may want to try out paragliding, which can be done solo or tandem. Oh, and did we mention Roaring Fork River, prime for river-rafting and fishing? Of course, you could just grab the closest leather jacket and hot mama (or papa) and, like many of the visiting biker crew, rent a Harley hog for a loud motorbike cruise down the mountain roads, scarf flying behind in the wind.
