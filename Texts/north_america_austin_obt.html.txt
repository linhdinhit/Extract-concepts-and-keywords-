 Off the Beaten Track  Just south of downtown, Town Lake is actually a dammed off section of the Colorado River, lined with hiking and biking trails. It's a very nice area - as you'd know if you were staying at the Hostelling International-Austin, whose windows overlook it. Northwest of the city on a bluff over the river, the Mayfield Estate and Nature Preserve is the former home of Texas Secretary of State and railroad commissioner Allison Mayfield. Mayfield settled this idyllic spot at the turn of the century, and for over 50 years he and his wife built up the estate's grounds with lily ponds, a gazebo overlooking the Colorado and a flower garden. The estate is very peaceful and far less crowded than the overlook at Mt Bonnell, the much-heralded highest point in the city.
