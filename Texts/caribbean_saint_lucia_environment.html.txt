 Environment  St Lucia is teardrop-shaped, roughly 27mi (44km) in length and 14mi (23km) in width. The interior is largely mountainous, reaching its highest point at the 3120ft (950m) Mt Gimie in the southwest. Deep valleys, many of which are planted with bananas and coconuts, reach down from the mountains.  The Soufriere area has the island's best-known geological features: the twin volcanic cones of the Pitons, which rise up some 2500ft (760m) from the shoreline, and the hot bubbling Sulphur Springs just inland from the town.  St Lucia's vegetation ranges from dry and scrubby areas of cacti and hibiscus to lush jungly valleys with wild orchids, bromeliads, heliconia and lianas. Under the British colonial administration much of St Lucia's rain forest was targeted for timber harvesting. In many ways the independent St Lucian government has proved a far more effective environmental force, and while only about 10% of the island remains covered in rain forest, most of it has now been set aside as nature reserve. The largest indigenous trees in the rain forest are the gommier, a towering gum tree, and the chatagnier, a huge buttress-trunked tree.  Island fauna includes the St Lucia parrot, St Lucian oriole, purple-throated Carib hummingbird, bats, lizards, iguana, tree frogs, introduced mongoose, the rabbitlike agouti and several snake species, including the venomous fer-de-lance and the boa constrictor. It's illegal to damage, collect, buy or sell any type of coral on St Lucia and nothing should be removed from any of the island's many marine reserves.
