 Attractions  In Chamberlain Square, the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery is famous for its excellent permanent collection of Pre-Raphaelite art. There's a room devoted to work by local lad Sir Edward Burne-Jones (1833-93) and you can see paintings by other members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (founded 1848), including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown. The museum has exhibitions celebrating the city's industries, and displays on local and natural history, ethnography and archaeology. Look out for William Morris' illustrations of Dante's Inferno and outside, Big Brum, Birmingham's answer to Big Ben. Don't miss the charming Edwardian Tea Room.
