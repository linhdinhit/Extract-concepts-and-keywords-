 Attractions  One of Berlin's most photographed sites, the Brandenburg Gate was once the boundary between East and West Berlin. The Wall came down in 1989 and the gate - long a symbol of division - became the very epitome of German reunification. The gate is the only remaining one of the 18 that once graced Berlin. It was designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans in 1791 in neoclassical style and crowned by an ornate sculpture representing the goddess Victory. She was spirited away to Paris in 1806 by Napoleon after his occupation of Berlin, and returned trimphantly in 1814, freed from the French by a gallant Prussian general. Political groups from various ideological corners hijacked the pliable Brandenburg Gate as the backdrop for their rallies and processions until 1961, when the wall was built and the gate sealed off in no-man's-land. In 1989, after the dissolution of the border, the area was reopened to the public. Today, traffic passes freely under the gate and enterprising scammers have long been selling hunks of Berlin Wall concrete, most of dubious authenticity. If the Berlin Wall was ever reconstructed from the fragments sold to tourists it could probably enclose the whole of Germany. In October 2002 the Gate was reopened after two years of restoration. If you need some time out, sit and contemplate peace in the Raum der Stille (Room of Silence) in the gate's north wing.
