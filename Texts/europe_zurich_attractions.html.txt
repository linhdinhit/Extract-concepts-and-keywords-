 Attractions  The Museum of Fine Arts is one of the most important of Zürich's many museums. The large permanent collection ranges from 15th-century religious art to the various schools of modern art. The work of big names such as Dali, Arp, Man Ray, Hockney, Bacon, Cezanne, Renoir, Manet, Monet and Gauguin is on display. There's a fair sprinkling of Picassos, a whole room devoted to Marc Chagall and the largest Edvard Munch collection outside Scandinavia.
