 When to Go  Spring and fall are the most temperate and scenic seasons throughout the Capital Region, but travel is eminently possible in other months. The Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean give the eastern part of Maryland fairly mild winters and humid summers. Rainfall is pretty steady through the year, but you're most likely to be reaching for the umbrellain July and August. Despite the downpours, the city is a lively place in summer with lots of outdoor events which keep buzzing long into the balmy Baltimore evenings.     Events  Baltimore hosts plenty of events, mainly in the summer months. From late April to early May Inner Harbor comes alive with the Baltimore Waterfront Festival. The Center Plaza Concert Series brings jazz, blues, salsa and reggae concerts downtown from May to July. Between late May and September there are free big band, swing, jazz and other bands at the Pier 6 Concert Pavillion. In July Patterson Park, north of Fells Point's Market Square, hosts the Chesapeake Turtle Derby - a series of turtle heats named after prominent Baltimoreans - and the Square sees the Hog Calling Contest, which is just what it sounds like. Artscape, held in July, is a celebration of local theater, music, arts and food in Mount Royal.   Defender's Day Celebration is 12 September, the anniversary of the War of 1812's Battle of Baltimore. Military drills, fireworks, and music all go off at Fort McHenry. In October, Baltimore's working boats sail through the harbor to be blessed.
