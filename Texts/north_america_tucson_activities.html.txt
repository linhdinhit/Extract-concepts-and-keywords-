 Activities  There's no shortage of activities in the Tucson area, thanks to its wonderful natural surrounds. Binocular-equipped Audubon disciples will have a field day (or two) with the local birdlife, such as hummingbirds, road-runners ( sans coyote) and elf owls. Physically more-demanding pastimes include hiking one or more of the many trails winding up into the nearby mountain ranges, rock climbing or skiing on Mt Lemmon, overnight horse riding excursions (accompanied by cook-outs under the stars) and hot-air ballooning over the remarkable landscape of southern Arizona. A number of Tucson-based companies also offer jeep tours of the desertscape.
