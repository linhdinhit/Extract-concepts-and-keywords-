 Off the Beaten Track  The largest and perhaps most significant archaeological site in the UAE, Jumeira dates to the 6th century AD. The settlement is particularly interesting because it straddles the pre-Islamic and Islamic eras. Today surrounded by shopping centers plying the spoils of modern-day Dubai's trade, this settlement was once a caravan station along a trade route linking Iraq to northern Oman.  Excavations have unearthed a series of stone walls that surrounded a seven-shop souq and a storage facility. Several homes, what is believed to be a governor's palace and several other structures that keep the archaeologists guessing can be viewed from behind a fence. If someone is working, you may be able to wrangle your way in. Relics, including glazed pottery, copper and iron items, glassware and coins, are on display at the museum for the Heritage and Diving Villages.
