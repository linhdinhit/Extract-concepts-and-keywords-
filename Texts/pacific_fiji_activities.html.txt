 Activities  Fiji caters for most outdoorsy activities, but some visitors prefer to be inert on a beach and practise hand-to-mouth skills with a tropical cocktail. Most travellers, however, go with plans to do some swimming, snorkelling or diving, and Fiji offers these as well as some excellent surfing, river rafting, wind surfing and sailing. There are fringing reefs all over the islands for splendid diving and snorkelling, but good surf breaks are fewer and farther between. The Mamanucas have some dedicated surfing resorts and good waves but you need a boat to get to the offshore reefs where they break. There are a few good breaks off Viti Levu including those near Sigatoka and the Suva lighthouse, and off Yanuca island.  On dry land you can go cycling, trekking and horse riding, or engage in the more cerebral 'activities' of bird-watching and exploring archaeological sites. Fiji is well set up for tourists and there are facilities everywhere offering equipment for hire, day tours and courses.
