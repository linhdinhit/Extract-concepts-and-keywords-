 Off the Beaten Track  Manono, lying in the stretch of water between 'Upolu and Savai'i, is almost entirely untouched by modern society. There are no dogs, no roads, no vehicles and no noise on this island. It's so quiet and peaceful that it makes 'Upolu look like a bustling metropolis. People live almost entirely in fale and enjoy a semi-subsistence lifestyle. Visitors are welcome on the island as long as respect is shown for the traditional way of life and an effort is made to help conserve the fragile ecosystem through environment-friendly activities.  To get to Manono island take a bus from Apia to the western end of 'Upolu and then a launch across to the island. Outrigger and canoe trips can be arranged.
