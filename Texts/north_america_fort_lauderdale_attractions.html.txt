 Attractions  Fort Lauderdale's Museum of Art is one of Florida's best. Reopened in 1985 in brand new (and architecturally impressive) digs just off the New River, the museum's permanent collection includes works by the likes of Picasso, Matisse, Dali and Warhol. Equally impressive are the growing collections of Cuban and ethnographic art, including large African and South American exhibits. You can't ever really know what you're going to see on a particular visit, as the enormity of the collection far outpaces the available space. If you're visiting in the fall, keep an eye out for the Hortt Memorial Exhibition & Competition, which showcases the best of area artists. The museum is centrally located in downtown Fort Lauderdale, north of the New River.
