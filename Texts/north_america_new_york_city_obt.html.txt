 Off the Beaten Track  From the working-class, urban clutter of Brooklyn to the sophisticated wineries of North Fork, Long Island is a study in geographic and economic contrasts. For most visitors, crossing the East River from Manhattan means a trip to the beach, whether the destination is crowded Jones Beach or Fire Island in Nassau, quiet Shelter Island or the showy Hamptons. You can get to Long Island on the Long Island Expressway from Manhattan or catch one of the many buses running from the East Side (the bus drivers know all the short cuts and may well get you there quicker than driving). A train also runs between Long Island and New York's Penn Station. There's plenty of public transport once you get there.
