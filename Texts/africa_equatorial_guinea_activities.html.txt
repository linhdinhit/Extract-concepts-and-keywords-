 Activities  Along the mainland coast there are some of the world's best beaches. Swimming is especially good here, though, surprisingly, you won't find many good spots to get your feet wet on Bioko. On the island, though, you will find great, secluded hiking trails, particularly in the southern half. If you're feeling adventurous, try mountain climbing the spectacular Piko Malabo volcano on Bioko. A government permit is required (it's a military area) and few travellers set foot in the region.
