 Activities  When the weather heats up, tubing, kayaking and canoeing are weekend mainstays at the lakes just west of Austin and along the waterways of Barton Springs Greenbelt, south of downtown. There are access points at several spots along Barton Creek. Likewise, the natural swimming pool at Barton Springs is hugely popular for summer dunks - the pool maintains a constant 68 F (21 C) year round. Birdwatching is another greenbelt attraction, and sightings of green and little blue herons, belted kingfishers and wood ducks are common. The nature trails of Zilker Nature Preserve are popular for hiking and walking.   Bicycling is another favorite pastime of Austinites, and there are some 30 miles (50km) worth of trails within the city limits, another stretch within the greenbelt and a 'veloway' through nearby Slaughter Creek Metropolitan Park. Rock climbing in the Hill Country is also big, and there's even one of those see-and-be-seen scene climbing gyms downtown.
