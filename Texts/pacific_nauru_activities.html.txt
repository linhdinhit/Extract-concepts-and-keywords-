 Activities  The diving is good around the island, with WWII wrecks and a fringing coral reef. Sport fishing is taking off, and owing to the deep seas close to shore, marlin, sailfish, wahoo and yellowfin tuna have all been caught not far from the marina. Swimming is good at a couple of places, including the boat harbour, but at some places it is not recommended owing to the treacherous currents. You can walk around the island in a day, and golf and tennis are also options.
