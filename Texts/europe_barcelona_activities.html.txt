 Activities  There are plenty of opportunities for exercise in this healthy, sports-keen city. If you're a golfer, you'll be itching to play in Spain, one of the capitals of the game. The only moderately difficult Club de Golf Sant Cugat is welcoming. For an easy run and a few gasps of fresh sea air, use the seafront stretch from Vila Ol mpica to Barceloneta. The promenades along the shoreline are your best bet for an obstacle-free skate or blade. If the beaches don't appeal, there are dozens of pools around the city where you can swim. Port Ol mpic has a bunch of watersports clubs and facilities. Tennis players can serve up some volleys at the Barcelona Tens Ol mpic, where you can also hire gear. Barcelona isn't the best spot for casual cycling, but the tourist office can point you in the right direction if you're really determined to escape the hills, pollution and bad drivers.
