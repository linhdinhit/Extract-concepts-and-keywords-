 Attractions  A busy commercial and university city, the Welsh capital doesn't usually appear near the top of visitors' must-see lists. However, those who linger will discover its striking city-centre castle, important national museum and art gallery, redeveloped docks area and pockets of beautiful architecture. Don't miss also the Millennium Stadium, opened in 1999 and home to Weslh Rugby. It's also the temporary venue for major English football matches. Cardiff is a good place to base yourself because it's surrounded by interesting sites and transport links are good.  Cardiff has a good selection of B&B accommodations, sprinkled along Cathedral Rd, to the west of the city centre, and on Newport Rd to the east. Purveyors of Welsh specialties such as rarebit (the Welsh version of cheese on toast) and laverbread (a nicer-than-you'd-think seaweed concoction) can be found in the city centre, along with coffee shops and bistros serving more usual fare. Rugby is Cardiff's most popular form of entertainment, but there's also theatre, an arts centre and a pop arena for those who want to avoid the scrum.
