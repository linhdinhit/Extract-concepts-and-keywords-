 Activities  After you've had your fill of culture at all those fabulous museums, head outside and take a tour - there are boat tours, architecture tours, walking tours, tram tours...even banking tours. Getting to know and love the Frankfurters' favourite tipple, apple wine (Ebbelwoi), can be a time-consuming activity, as is competing with the local burghers' boundless appetite for eating. Cycling is made easier by the provision of bike lanes. Outdoor swimming is pretty popular in Frankfurt, and the swimming centres usually come with a bunch of slides and waterfalls, table tennis, volleyball and grassy knolls for sunbathing. Going to the gym is as much a part of social life as going to the pub, and you'll probably meet the same people in both places. If you use a sauna or steamroom, though, you'd better be comfortable with nudity. In-line skating has taken Frankfurt by storm, and is even an officially recognised form of transport in the city. Golf is pretty much for the elite, and definitely not for green-hackers.
