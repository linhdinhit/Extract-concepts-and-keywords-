 Environment  Much of Macedonia is a plateau between 600m and 900m (1970ft and 2950ft) high. The Vardar River cuts across the middle of the country, passing the capital, Skopje, on its way to the Aegean Sea near Thessaloniki, Greece. Lakes Ohrid and Prespa in the south-west drain into the Adriatic via Albania. These lakes are among the largest on the Balkan Peninsula, and Lake Ohrid is the deepest. In the north-west, the Sar Planina marks Macedonia's border with Kosovo; Titov vrh (2750m/9010ft) in this range is Macedonia's highest peak. The country's three national parks are Pelister (west of Bitola), Galicica (between Lakes Ohrid and Prespa) and Mavrovo (between Ohrid and Tetovo).  Macedonia's summers are hot and dry. In winter, warm Aegean winds blowing up the Vardar Valley moderate the continental conditions prevailing farther north. However, Macedonia receives a lot of snowfall between November and February, even if temperatures are warmer than those farther north.
