 Attractions  Montevideo's port market was the continent's finest when it opened back in 1868, but today it survives on personality and atmosphere, of which there are plenty. The old port market building is an impressive wrought-iron superstructure which houses outstanding seafood restaurants as well as the more traditional grills that sell parillas (choose your cut off the grill). If you like your food carnivorous, this place will set the drool glands racing. It's open only in the afternoons, and Saturday is a particularly lively and colorful day, with artists, craftspeople and street musicians plying their trade and just hanging out with other Uruguayans. For the thirsty, there is also the Montevideo speciality medio y medio, a popular knockout blend of sparkling and white wines.
