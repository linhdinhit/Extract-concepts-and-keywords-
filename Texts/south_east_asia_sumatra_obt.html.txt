 Off the Beaten Track  Time, patience and endurance are vital if you intend to wander off Sumatra's tourist trail, and such travel is not overly encouraged by authorities. The beautiful mountain lake of Danau Ranau is in the Bukit Barisan mountains of southern Sumatra. It is one of the least spoiled - and least accessible - of Sumatra's mountain lakes, and you can hike, climb Gunung Seminung (1881m/6170ft) or relax in the quiet atmosphere and cool climate.  Most routes to Danau Ranau go through the Trans-Sumatran Highway town of Baturaja, which you can reach from the main terminal in Palembang. From Baturaja it is a three and a half hour trip to Bandar Agung, by the lake, with a change at Simpangsender.
