 Activities  There are great snorkeling, diving and swimming around the Bay and Hog Islands, and nice beaches around Tela and Trujillo. For the best walks, try Parque Nacional Celaque, 45km (28mi) southeast of Santa Rosa de Cop n. It contains the country's highest peak, a lush cloud forest, the headwaters of 10 rivers and a majestic waterfall. There are also vertical cliffs for expert mountain climbers. Parque Nacional Pico Bonito, a few kilometers south of La Ceiba, has trails around the fringes of the 500 sq km (195 sq mi) unexplored reserve and a challenging peak for mountaineers.
