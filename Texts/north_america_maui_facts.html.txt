 When to Go  Maui is balmy and warm, with northeasterly trade winds prevailing most of the year. Average temperatures differ only about 7 F from winter to summer. Near the coast, daily temperatures average a high of about 83 F (28 C) and a low of around 68 F (20 C). Winter is between December and March, when about twice as much rain falls as in summer. This is the high season, largely because of the unappealing weather on the US mainland. Winter storms can last for days, which can make this season slightly less appealing than summer, but not by much. If you're on a tight budget, low season is April to mid-December, when accommodation rates are cut by up to 30%. Avid divers should come in summer, keen surfers in winter.     Events  Maui celebrates all the traditional American holidays, such as Independence Day and Thanksgiving. In early April, the world's top windsurfing competition, the O'Neill Invitational, is held at Hookipa Beach. Also in early April, the Ulupalakua Thing shows off the talents of Maui's top chefs.  May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii, with lei-making competitions and compulsory lei donning. Around July 4, Maui's cowboy country hosts the old-fashioned Makawao Rodeo. In August the Haleakala Run to the Sun is 36.2 mi (58km) of sweat and panting from sea-level Paia to the top of Haleakala, and in September the scenic 54mi (87km) Hana Relay runs from Kahului to Hana. All things Hawaiian are celebrated during September's Aloha Week.
