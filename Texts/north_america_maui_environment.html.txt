 Environment  At 728 sq mi (1886 sq km), Maui is the second-largest Hawaiian island. The landmass originally arose from the ocean floor as two separate volcanoes, but lava flows and soil erosion eventually built up a valley-like isthmus between the two, linking them in their present form. The flat strip of interconnecting land provides a fertile setting for fields of sugarcane and has given Maui the nickname 'The Valley Island.'  Maui's larger (and younger) eastern side is dominated by 10,023ft (3007m) Haleakala, the world's largest dormant volcano. West Maui is overlooked by the West Maui Mountains. The rainy northeast sides of both mountain masses are cut with deep ravines and valleys leading down to the coast. White-sand beaches run along much of the island's western shoreline.  Haleakala is the place to spot the endangered nene (Hawaiian goose) and rare silversword plant. Equally endangered are Maui's six native birds: the Maui parrotbill, nuku puu, creeper, akepa, crested honeycreeper and poouli. Maui is the best Hawaiian island for viewing humpback whales, particularly January-March.
