It's worth taking this into consideration when deciding when to go, but as a general rule the best time to visit is September or October. May through to August can also be pleasant, although you run the risk of a snow flurry or two and low temperatures early in the season.     Events  There are very few ritual events celebrated in Moldova, mostly because the republic is still in its infancy and is experiencing painful teething problems. It's hardly had time to clear away the rubble from all the old Lenin statues, let alone organise feasts, fetes and fiestas. The one truly Moldovan event is Independence Day, celebrated on 27 August. For the residents of Transdniestr this is like waving a red rag at a bull, and celebrations are usually boycotted by those living east of the Dniestr River.
