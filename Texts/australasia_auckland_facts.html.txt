 When to Go  Auckland's busiest tourist season arrives with the warmer weather between November and April and hits its peak during summer school holidays (20 December-late January). To a lesser extent the Easter weekend, Labour Day weekend (late October) and the mid-year school holidays are also busy. January and February are the best beach-weather months, but December and March are usually warm - even hot at times. November and April are slightly cooler and not so good for hanging aorund at the beach, but it's noticeably quieter, and accommodation is easier to find.     Events  The summer months are a happening time in Auckland. In January the arrival of Captain Hobson in New Zealand is celebrated in the Auckland Anniversary and Regatta, there is a swag of tennis championships and Auckland's parks host a bunch of music events. Come March, the hugely popular Pasifika Festival celebrates Polynesian culture through music and performance at Western Springs. The Waiheke Jazz Festival also tunes up and full-size Maori waka (war canoes) take to the Waikato River, Ngaruawahia, for the Turangawaewae Regatta. November blooms with the Ellerslie Flower Show at the Botanic Gardens, and the year is wrapped up with the Auckland Cup at Ellerslie Race Course. Various small food, wine and music festivals crop up throughout the year.
