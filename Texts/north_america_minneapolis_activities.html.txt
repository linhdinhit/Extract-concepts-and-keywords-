 Activities  Bikers in downtown Minneapolis can escape to the Mississippi River Regional Park and its network of riverside biking and walking trails. Another option is the Grand Rounds Parkway, a bucolic path skirting the shores of the Mighty Miss and Minnehaha Creek. Along the way you get a bird's-eye view of the spectacular 45ft (13m) Minnehaha Falls - the very ones celebrated in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem Song of Hiawatha.  Folks in the Twin Cities are mad about fishing, no doubt because 949 lakes dot the greater metro area (yes, somebody counted them). Drop a line and you're virtually guaranteed to bag a bass, trout or freshwater salmon. When the weather heats up, canoeing and kayaking become weekend mainstays on these same tranquil tarns.  Being snowbound for months isn't so bad, not if you're into skiing, dog sledding and snowmobiling, all prime winter pursuits. Thrill-seeking skiers may be disappointed - these ain't the Alps, after all. Yet what Minnesota lacks in vertical drop, it makes up for with scenery and convenience. Especially convenient are the 7 downhill and 25 cross-country ski areas within a 45-minute drive of downtown Minneapolis. Winter wonderland indeed.
