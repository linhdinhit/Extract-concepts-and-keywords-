 When to Go  The best times to visit Crete are late spring to early summer and autumn, when the tourist infrastructure has geared up but you won't have to contend with the crowds of summer tourists. The weather is usually pleasantly warm during this time, but not too hot, and swimming is possible.     Events  The Greek year is a succession of festivals and events. There are cultural and wine festivals throughout Crete during summer and each town celebrates the day allocated to their patron saint. The most important cultural festivals include: the Renaissance Festival in Rethymno, the Kyrvia Festival in Ierapetra, Sitia's Kornaria Festival, Iraklio's Summer Arts Festival and the Lato Festival in Agios Nikolas.   Easter is taken much more seriously than any other religious holiday throughout Greece. Try to attend a Palm Sunday ceremony, which ends with fireworks and a candle-lit procession. Other holidays of significance include: Epiphany on 6 January, Independence Day on 25 March, May Day on 1 May (when everyone seems to go into the countryside for picnics), The Battle of Crete during the last week of May and Assumption Day on 15 August, which is celebrated with family reunions.
