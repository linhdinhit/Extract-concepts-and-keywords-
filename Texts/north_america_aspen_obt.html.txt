 Off the Beaten Track  About 70mi (113km) long from its start near Independence Pass to the Colorado River, the Roaring Fork is a body of water with one free-flowing personality. The Ute Indians, early residents of the area, named it 'Thunder River,' and it isn't a stretch to imagine why. In its relatively short distance it changes drastically in elevation - shifting about 7000ft (2134m) total - making for variable, erratic depths and scenery that takes in everything from dramatic canyons to aspen-treed landscapes. It's the rushing artery of Aspen with all manner of activities surrounding it. Scenic whitewater trips are available with local guides; full daytrips generally include lunch. Fishers reel in trout (brown and rainbow) and whitefish - the river is said to have the best winter fishing in the state.
