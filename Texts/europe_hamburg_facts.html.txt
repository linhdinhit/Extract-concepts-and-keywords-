 When to Go  There isn't really a single time of year that is better than any other to visit Hamburg, because it can be chilly year round. While Germany can have pleasant summer weather, northern areas are known for their year-round Reizklima, or 'healthy, bracing climate'. Summer temperatures don't creep much over 20 C (68 F). Winter is prime ski time if you want to head south for the alps of the Harz Mountains.     Events  Hamburg's social schedule is packed all year with concerts, fairs, festivals, parties, conventions and exhibitions, but there are a few standout occasions. Established in 1329, Hamburger Dom is one of Europe's largest and oldest funfairs; it takes place in late March, late July and late November. Kicking off on 7 May, the Hafengeburtstag (Harbour Birthday) is a wild party raging on and off shore to celebrate the day the German Emperor Barbarossa granted the city customs exemption and secured its future as a trading power.  Most banks and businesses close on public holidays, which along with the usual New Year's Day, Easter and Christmas include Labour Day (1 May), Ascension (May), Whitsun (May/June), Wäldchestag (May/June), Corpus Christi (May/June) and German Unification (3 October).
