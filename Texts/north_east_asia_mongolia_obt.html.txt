 Off the Beaten Track  After Erdene Zuu Khiid in Kharkhorin, Amarbayasgalant Khiid is considered the most important monastery in Mongolia. It's also one of the most beautiful. Situated in northern central Mongolia, Amarbayasgalant Khiid was originally built in 1737 by the Manchurian king Kansu, who dedicated it to the great Mongolian Buddhist and sculptor, Zanabazar. The communists found their way here in the 1930s and destroyed 10 of the 37 temples and statues. These days the temples are normally closed but you can ask the head monk to open them and you're welcome to watch the 30 resident monks conduct their daily ceremonies.   A daily bus and frequent express trains link Ulaan Baatar and Darkhan, which is 219km (136mi) north-west of the capital. The monastery is 140km (87mi) south-east of Darkhan; you'll need a jeep to reach the monastery from Darkhan.
