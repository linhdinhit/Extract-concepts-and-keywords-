 When to Go  Salzburg is a year-round destination so when you go depends on what you want to do or see. The summer high season is in July and August, when both large crowds and high prices may be a turn off. June and September are also busy months for tourism. Winter can get very cold but things will be less crowded and hotel prices will be lower (except over Christmas and Easter). Winter sports are in full swing from mid-December to late March.     Events  A high point on the city's cultural calendar is the Salzburg Festival ( Salzburger Festspiele) from late July to the end of August. It's a great time to see the city come to life, if you don't mind huge crowds. The festival includes an amazing number of orchestral, operatic and theatrical events and music ranging from classical to contemporary. Other important music festivals include Osterfestspiele for one week at Easter and the Pfingstokonzerte held on the Whit Sunday weekend. Mozart Week is held in late January and the city is also known for its Christkindlmarkt (Christmas Market) in December.
