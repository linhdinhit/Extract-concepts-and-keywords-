 Off the Beaten Track  Any place where the motorists stop for pedestrians must have something to recommend it. But Colonia has much more to it than simply being a friendly place. It is a remarkable town full of historical significance. Its colonial streets, shaded by sycamores from the summer heat, contain treasures such as the superb 17th-century Portuguese contraband port, La Colonia Portuguesa, and fortress of Colonia. Popular with Argentines, it is something of an unappreciated gem along the foreign tourism route but is gaining an ever-greater audience. Close enough to Buenos Aires across the Rio de la Plata to almost smell it (less than an hour by hydrofoil) and an easy day trip from Montevideo, Colonia is an absolute must-see.
