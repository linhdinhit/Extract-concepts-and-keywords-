 Activities  You can leave downtown and be on the slopes at the Sandia Peak Ski Area in less than an hour. It has 26 downhill skiing runs for a range of abilities, plus the cross-country skiing attraction of the Sandia Crest National Skiing Byway. You can access Sandia Peak via the Tramway or via Hwys 14 and 536. Mountain bikers can hop on Sandia Peak's chairlifts with their bikes in summer for some giddy downhill cycling.  If you only have time for one hike while you're in town, the beautiful 7mi (11km) La Luz Trail to the top of the Sandias is the one to take. The trail passes through high desert and pine forest, and offers spectacular views over Albuquerque, the West Mesa and the mountain ranges beyond. There are gentle hiking trails in the 270 acre (108 hectare) Rio Grande Nature Center, 4 miles (6.5km) northwest of downtown. Trails wind through meadows and groves, and there's a chance you'll spot raccoons and maybe even a coyote. There are several trails in the Albert G Simms Park which both hikers and mountain bikers can enjoy.  The Sandia Lakes Recreation Area, approximately 10mi (16km) north of Albuquerque, has three lakes well stocked with trout and bass for the angler not wanting to come away empty handed; fishing permits are required. About a dozen companies offer hot-air balloon rides around Albuquerque; ask at the visitors bureau for a comprehensive list. Spanish priests began growing grapes and making wine in the mid-17th century, and local wine production experienced a revival in 1960s. There are now several vineyards in or near the city offering tastings and tours.
