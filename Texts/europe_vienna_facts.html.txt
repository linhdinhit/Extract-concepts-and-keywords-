 When to Go  There's almost always something happening in Vienna, making it a year-round destination. Weatherwise you might want to miss January's chill, and July and August's heat - you won't be able to see the Lipizzaners and the Boys' Choir in those summer months anyway. June and September are particularly good times to visit, though you'll find that everyone else thinks so too, making things somewhat busy. As always, it's a good idea to opt for the less-crowded spring/autumn shoulder months of April-May and October-November.     Events  Vienna celebrates its rich musical history year round with a surfeit of musical styles, although Mozart, who had his most productive years here, naturally enough features heavily. The Viennese year kicks off with sumptuous costumed balls in January and February. Classical music takes over in March with the month-long Spring Festival and Easter's OsterKlang Festival. The Vienna Marathon is run in May, and the year's cultural highlight is the month-long Vienna Festival (mid-May to mid-June), featuring a wide-ranging program of the arts. Musical events pop up all over the city during the July-August KlangBogen Festival, Opera Film Festival and International Dance Festival. Trade fairs come to town in September, and October features the annual Viennale Film Festival. November's Wien Modern festival focuses on avant-garde music for a change, and the year winds up with the traditional Christmas market ( Christkindlmarkt) held in front of the Rathaus.  Vienna's public holidays are New Year's Day (1 January), Epiphany (6 January), Easter Monday (March/April), Labour Day (1 May), Ascension Day (40 days after Easter), Whit Monday, Corpus Christi, Assumption (15 August), National Day (26 October), All Saints' Day (1 November), Immaculate Conception (8 December), Christmas Day (25 December) and St Stephen's Day (26 December). Some people also take a holiday on Good Friday.
