 Off the Beaten Track  The Soca Valley, defined by the aquamarine Soca River, stretches from Triglav National Park to the Italian border town of Nova Gorica and is one of the most beautiful and peaceful spots in Slovenia. It wasn't always. During much of WWI, this was the site of the infamous Soca Front, which claimed the lives of an estimated 1 million people and was immortalised by Ernest Hemingway in his novel A Farewell to Arms.  In 1917, combined Austrian, German, Hungarian and Slovenian forces met in Kobarid, on the front, and defeated the Italian army. It was the greatest breakthrough of WWI. Visitors flock to Mediterranean-style Kobarid (known as Caporetto to Hemingway) to relive these events at the award-winning, anti-war Kobarid Museum.  Half a dozen buses travel between Kobarid and Ljubljana daily. Kobarid is about 150km (93mi) northwest of the capital. Due north 21km (13mi) is Bovec, an adventure sports centre full of hiking, kayaking, mountain biking and skiing opportunities.
