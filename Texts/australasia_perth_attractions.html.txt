 Attractions  Check out the superb views from Kings Park, the lungs of the city centre. The park includes a 17 hectare (42 acre) Botanic Garden and a section of natural bushland, which represents Perth as it was before the white fella got here. In spring, there's a cultivated display of Western Australia's famed wild flowers. The park also has some pleasant bike tracks - you can hire bikes just outside the park - and a coffee shop.
