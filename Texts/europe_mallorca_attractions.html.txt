 Attractions  Around half of Mallorca's population live in the capital, Palma, and it's a buzzing, vibrant place. After dark, its famous nightlife rivals other Spanish cities. By day, you can explore the attractive old quarter, crammed with cobbled lanes, tree-lined boulevards, Gothic churches and designer boutiques. You're unlikely to be alone; the city is usually packed with tourists, and you'll pass tacky souvenir shops on every corner. If you fancy hitting a nearby beach, your choice is limited to tourist developments a bus-ride away.  You can't miss the imposing Gothic cathedral, built between 1230 and 1600. Visitors can wonder at Gaudi's curious wrought-iron sculpture hanging from the ceiling and check out the adjacent museum of shiny religious artefacts. In front of the cathedral stands the Palau de l'Almudaina, an Islamic castle that became a Mallorcan royal residence. The winding streets of the surrounding historic quarter are home to the Museu de Mallorca, a converted 15th-century palace containing archaeological finds, antiques and paintings of local dignitaries. The Banyas Arabas (Arab Baths) are also in this area. Opposite the waterfront is Gothic masterpiece La Llotja, which contains an art museum. Just west of the city centre is the impressive Bellver Castle.  When you're looking for a hotel, don't be tempted by the waterfront tourist places west of the centre - they are a long way from anywhere. Central Palma is at the heart of the action and the best place to aim for. If you're looking to party, the happening old quarter has more bars and pubs - from flashy tourist haunts to stylish bodegas - than you can shake a pint at.
