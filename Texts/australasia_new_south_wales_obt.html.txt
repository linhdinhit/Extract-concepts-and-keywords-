 Off the Beaten Track  If there was a wino's wonderland then the Hunter Valley - with over 60 vineyards in the Lower Hunter to taste, quaff and gulp your way through - would be it. Sydneysiders regularly make the weekend jaunt to the region's beaches, including the tranquil Myall Lakes National Park or popular Port Stephens, famous for its great surf and resident pod of dolphins.  In the convict days, Newcastle was known as 'the hell of NSW' as it housed only the hardest criminals, but these days Novacastrians have become a little friendlier and the city has a thriving music and arts scene; in particular it spawned rock titans, Silverchair.  The Hunter Valley is an easy 110km (68mi) drive from Sydney, with excellent rail and bus links if you want someone else to do the driving.
