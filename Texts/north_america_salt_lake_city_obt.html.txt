 Off the Beaten Track  This huge, shallow lake about 10 miles (16km) northwest of downtown covers an area of between 900-2500 sq miles (2300-6500 sq km), depending on spring runoff and summer heat evaporation. It's the largest lake in the USA west of the Great Lakes. High rates of evaporation mean the lake generally experiences salinity levels around 20% (compared to 3.5% in seawater). The lake is still recovering from record-breaking snowfalls in the early 1980s, which caused salinity to drop to 6%. So don't get too concerned about your dietary habits if unsinkably salty buoyancy isn't all it's cracked up to be. The decrease in salinity has also reduced the number of brine flies and brine shrimp that attract migrating birds. The Great Salt Lake has been declared a World Heritage bird sanctuary, so it's not surprising that the main attraction here is bird-watching (there are no fish in the lake) and enjoying the unique environment.
