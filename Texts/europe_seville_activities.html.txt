 Activities  There's a great deal to do in Seville apart from seeing the sights, partying all night and betting on corridas ( bullfights). Cycling around town is an excellent way to explore the city. Attending a local Real Betis or Sevilla football (soccer) match is a great way to meet the local fanatics. Shopping for luxury items, clothes, arts and crafts and other goods is also a popular pastime. The colorful Thursday flea market ( mercadillo) is well worth a visit. After dark, flamenco song and dance shows heat things up in Triana's smoky bars - steer clear of expensive, tourist-oriented tablaos unless you're looking for the Mickey Mouse version of Spain.
