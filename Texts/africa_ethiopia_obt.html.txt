 Off the Beaten Track  About 750km north of Addis Ababa, Gondar was the capital of Ethiopia from its foundation by Emperor Fasilidas in 1632 until 1886. The piazza - a grandiose name for an unremarkable small square - is the heart of the modern town. It's look a worth inside the 76,000 sq m Royal Enclosure for a glimpse of the castle built in 1640. Your ticket also admits you to the royal Bath of Fasilldas, about 2km out of town on the Bahar Dar road.  Don't be persuaded to visit the 'Falasha village,' about 7km out of town; there's only one Falasha left after the mass emigration to Israel - and even her credentials are dubious.
