 Activities  There's no doubt that Cabo is all about the great outdoors. Even if you're just walking along the beaches to witness the rock formations at Land's End you'll still find your pulse racing. But take a big breath in and duck under the waves, because the snorkeling and diving here are excellent. Beginners can test the waters at Roca Pelicano (Pelican Rock), where there's plenty of tropical fish schooling, and Land's End, where you can get cosy with sea lions. More advanced divers jump in the deep end at Sands Falls, which was once the subject of a Jacques Cousteau documentary, or at Neptune's Finger, known for its amazing canyon wall dive.  For some folk, the only way to really experience sea creatures is on the end of a line, which is why Cabo has a reputation as the marlin fishing destination. There are blue and striped species of the famed game fish, but a few other sea creatures - including tuna, wahoo, sharks, roosterfish and dorado - will be just as keen to tug your line. If you haven't got your own boat and rig, plenty of tour companies offer 8-hour tours, or you can hire a panga (skiff) to net the smaller fish. The marlin numbers are protected by the Cape region's catch and release policy - you have to throw back every fish caught after the first. You won't have fought the fish for nothing, however, as the Billfish Foundation awards Release Certificates to anglers.  From January to March, the gray whale migration makes whale watching possible even from the shore, though there are tour operators who can get you closer to the action. There's also horseback riding and cycling around the area, including a breathtaking horseback ride up to Faro Viejo to watch the sunset.
