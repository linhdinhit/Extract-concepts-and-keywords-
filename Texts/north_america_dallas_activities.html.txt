 Activities  Dallas has more than 50,000 acres (20,000ha) of public parks, most notably Fair Park, White Rock Lake Park northeast of downtown and Bachman Lake just northwest of Love Field. The longest bicycling and hiking trail is the 17-mile (27km) path around White Rock Lake. A 3-mile (5km) trail circles Bachman Lake. Trinity Trails is a network of hiking, biking and equestrian trails covering 35 miles (56km) along the Trinity River, Sycamore Creek and Marine Creek. It can be accessed from most of Fort Worth's major parks, including Heritage Park, where you can rent equipment for canoeing, kayaking or pedal boating. And a trip to Texas wouldn't be complete without at least one attempt at horseback riding. There are places to rent horses on the edge of the Stockyards National Historic District in Fort Worth.
