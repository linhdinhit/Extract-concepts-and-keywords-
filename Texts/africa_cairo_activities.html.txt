 Activities  Feluccas, the ancient broad-sail boats seen all along the Nile, can be hired out by the hour from several places along the Corniche, and are great for a sunset cruise after a hard day's sightseeing. Saddling up for a horseback ride out by the Pyramids, especially in the evening, is a great way to escape the clamour of Cairo, but be sure to hire only a healthy horse - many aren't fit to ride. Billiards, snooker and tenpin bowling have really taken off in Cairo in a big way. If you've ever fancied baring your midriff and making it ripple then there is no shortage of belly-dance teachers around town. There are also plenty of places to see a belly-dancing display.  There isn't much greenery in Cairo, but if you can find it, a stroll among the all-too-rare foliage has something going for it. Try the Nady al-Qahira Garden, Orman Botanical Gardens, zoo, Manial Palace or Gezira Club. Despite the heat, lack of land and water shortage, golf is a recent addition to Cairo's outdoor pursuits. If the heat and terrifying drivers don't put you off , the Cairo Cyclists club organises cycling events. Swimming is a great way to cool off but finding a pool isn't easy (or cheap); try a hotel pool - the Forte Grande near the Pyramids and Le Meridien Cairo are both worth splashing out for. If all else fails, take a course: Arabic, Egyptology and Islamic history and religion are on offer at a range of institutions. Sometimes being a spectator is as energetic as you want to get in the heat; if so, you can see Sufi dancing, football matches and horse-racing.
