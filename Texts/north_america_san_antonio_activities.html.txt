 Activities  A few miles north of downtown, Brackenridge Park is a favorite San Antonian getaway spot, with serene offerings including boat rentals, hiking trails, a little putt-putt railroad and an old fashioned carousel. Its main attraction - other than its sylvan setting - is that it's the headspring for the San Antonio River. There are bridle paths here as well, and you can rent horses from nearby stables. A few miles farther northwest, Friedrich Park comprises over 200 acres (80 hectares) of trails and rewarding vistas.  Closer to downtown, try San Pedro Park for its tennis courts, swimming pool and wide stretches of green. It's three blocks north of downtown, next to San Antonio College on San Pedro St.  San Antonio is just south of a number of the Hill Country's spectacular limestone caves, and spelunking has become a popular pastime. Bicycling trips, whether wheeling around the city or eating up the local hills and plains, is also gaining favor. Ask in any of the city's bike shops about cycling trails and the self-guided tour information for Mission Trail rides.
