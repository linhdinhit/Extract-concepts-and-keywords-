 When to Go  Summer (June to August) is considered peak season, when hotels typically raise their rates and the Great Wall nearly collapses under the weight of marching tourists. The autumn months between September and November have the best weather and fewer tourists. Spring is less pleasant - not many tourists but lots of wind and dust. In winter, you'll have Beijing to yourself and many hotels offer substantial discounts - just remember it's an ice box outside. Everything is chock-a-block during the Chinese New Year (usually in January or February).     Events   Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival, is by far the biggest festival of the year. It starts on the first day of the first moon according to the traditional lunar calendar, in January or February. Although officially lasting only three days, many people take a week off work. Fifteen days after the New Year is the Lantern Festival. Though not a public holiday, it's a colourful time to visit Beijing, with people walking the streets at night carrying coloured paper lanterns. The birthday of Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, is a great time to visit Buddhist temples. It happens on the 19th day of the second moon (March/April).   Tomb Sweeping Day is a day for worshipping ancestors; people visit the graves of their dearly departed relatives and clean their gravesites. They often burn 'ghost money' (for use in the afterworld) for the departed. It falls on 5 April in the Gregorian calendar in most years; 4 April in leap years. Beijing is probably at its prettiest on the first of May, a holiday for Communists officially known as International Labour Day. During this time, the whole city (especially Tiananmen Square) is decorated with flowers. The Mid-Autumn Festival is also known as the Moon Festival and is the time to eat tasty moon cakes. It takes place in September, on the 15th day of the 8th moon. October sees a celebration of Confucius' birthday.
