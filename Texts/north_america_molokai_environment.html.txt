 Environment  Molokai is Hawaii's fifth largest Island, 38 miles long and 10 miles wide (61km by 16km) and roughly rectangular in shape. It lies midway in the Hawaiian chain, about 25 miles southeast of Oahu and nine miles northwest of Maui.  Geologically speaking, Molokai is a union of two separate shield volcanoes that erupted to form two distinct islands. In the East, waves of lava threw up high mountains which acted as a funnel, trapping the clouds and causing heavy rainfall and stream erosion to cut deep valleys where today luxuriant rainforest grows. The West formed into more modest hills and tableland. Later eruptions spilled lava into the channel that separated the two volcanoes, forming the Hoolehua Plains and creating present-day Molokai.  Molokai has rich soil, and some feel the island may have the potential to be Hawaii's 'breadbasket.' After pineapple plantations left Molokai in the late 1970s, islanders began to develop small-scale farming more intensely. Significant crops include coffee, watermelons, dryland taro, macadamia nuts, sweet potatoes, seed corn, string beans and onions. Molokai stays warm and sunny all the year round, with an average annual rainfall of 27 inches (70cm).
