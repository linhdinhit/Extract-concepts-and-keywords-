 Activities  Jamaica has a panoply of sports and special-interest activities for those to whom bumming out on the beach spells boredom. Hikers could spend weeks exploring Jamaica's embryonic trail system, mainly in the Blue Mountains, or tramping rough bridle tracks nationwide. Rugged Cockpit Country is little explored, yet tailor-made for experienced hikers. Horseback riding is a great way to explore Jamaica and most resort areas have stables. Many organized rides lead through plantations, with some trekking far into the country's interior. Jamaica's boasts 10 championship golf courses, some of which are regular stops for the PGA and LPGA tours. Tryall Golf Club, 12 miles (19km) west of Montego Bay, is the pre-eminent course.  Jamaica's shores are as beautiful below the surface as they are above, especially along the north coast, where conditions are wonderful for scuba diving. Treasures range from shallow reefs, caverns, and trenches, to walls and drop-offs just a few hundred yards off-shore. Most resorts provide small sailboats, and yachts and cruisers can be rented as part of hotel packages or at daily or weekly rates. Jamaica has spelunkers salivating. The island is honeycombed with limestone caves and caverns, particularly in the west, but extreme caution should always be exercised, especially in unmapped areas.
