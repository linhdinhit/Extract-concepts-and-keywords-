 Activities  If you feel like taking part in a bit of neighbourhood rough and tumble, the most popular games are cricket, soccer and badminton - there are floodlit village badminton courts everywhere, and if you can play you'll have no problem meeting people (if you're a guy, that is). Keen boaters should visit the Sunderbans, where rowboats are the only way to get around the majority of this mangrove national park.
