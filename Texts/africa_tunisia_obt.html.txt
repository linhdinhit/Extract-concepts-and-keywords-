 Off the Beaten Track  The port of Bizerte, 65km (40mi) north of Tunis, is the largest city in Northern Tunisia. It sees very few tourists, which is one reason why it's worth a visit. There are a few decent beaches near town, but the main attraction is the architecture of the unspoiled traditional quarter of the old port.  The enormous kasbah is the most impressive structure in the old town, with its massive walls towering over the northern side of the entrance to the old harbour. Originally a Byzantine fort built in the 6th century AD, the present fort was built by the Ottomans in the 17th century. The ksibah (small fort) forms the southern bastion of the harbour defences built by the Byzantines and has also been modified over the centuries. It now houses a small but good oceanographic museum.  The Place Bouchoucha - more of a thoroughfare than a square - lies at the heart of the old Ottoman town, flanked by the old port to the east and the medina to the west. The area houses some lively fish markets; the Great Mosque, built in 1652 with a striking octagonal minaret; and the beautifully inlaid Youssef Dey fountain, built ten years before the mosque. The so-called Spanish Fort overlooks the town from the hill north of the medina - it's actually Turkish and was built around 1570 AD.
