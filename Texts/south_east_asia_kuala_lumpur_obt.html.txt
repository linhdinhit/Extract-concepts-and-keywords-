 Off the Beaten Track  Just 13km (8mi) north of the city, the huge Batu Caves are among KL's best known tourist attractions. Now used for Hindu festivals and pilgrimages, the caves also form an intense backdrop to the spectacularly masochistic feats performed annually by Thaipusam devotees. The main cave, a vast open space known as the Temple Cave - is reached by a 272-step climb. Beyond the stairs is the main temple. There are several other smaller caves in the same formation, including one with elaborately painted Hindu figures. The caves can be reached by either the 11D bus (from the Central Market) or bus 69 from Jalan Pudu. The trip takes about half an hour.
