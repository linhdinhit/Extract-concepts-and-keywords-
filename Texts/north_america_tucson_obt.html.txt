 Off the Beaten Track  The splendid Santa Catalinas, part of Arizona's expansive Coronado National Forest, are geographically sandwiched between Tucson and, appropriately, the Tortilla Mountains. An outdoor nirvana for the many Tucson residents who want to escape the pain of indoor office-work or domestics, this mountain range encourages such relaxing activities as hiking, horse riding, bird watching and navel gazing. The most popular access point from Tucson is Sabino Canyon, a water-sluiced cutting serviced by a scenic 4mi (6.5km) road, numerous riverside picnic grounds and lots of lengthy hiking trails leading to higher ground. At the canyon entrance is an information-stocked visitor centre and ranger station.  A more remote locale for hiking and camping is Catalina State Park, 15mi (24km) north of Tucson in the Santa Catalina's western foothills. The area offers a range of day and multi-day walks, and some of the trails have attractive added extras such as swimming holes. The highpoint of the mountain range - and a favoured getaway year-round - is Mt Lemmon, which stretches up to 9157ft (2750m). In summer you can spend several days walking up to the summit's great views, or alternatively drive there in a single hour, while in winter the mountainside is transformed into the southernmost ski resort in the USA.
