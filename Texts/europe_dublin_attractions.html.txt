 Attractions  Ireland's premier university was founded in 1592 by Elizabeth I, who hoped its distance from the European continent would save its students from being 'infected with popery'. Officially called the University of Dublin, the 16-hectare (40-acre) institution was the sole preserve of Protestants, and even when this restriction was lifted in 1793, the Catholic Church forbade its young from attending. This restriction was only wholly lifted in 1970!  The grounds of Trinity College are great to explore independently, although the College does run organised tours that are also recommended. Either way, the focus of any trip to the university is a visit to the famous Book of Kells, a magnificent 1200-year-old illustrated manuscript, and one of the oldest books in the world. About half a million people a year come to see the book - usually opened to an illustrated page and a page of text - so expect long, long queues in the peak tourist season. Once you've seen the book, don't rush off - there are other interesting buildings open to the public and worth visiting, including the Library Long Room, the Reading Room and a 45-minute audiovisual display called The Dublin Experience. Trinity College is located south of the River Liffey, near Pearse Station.
