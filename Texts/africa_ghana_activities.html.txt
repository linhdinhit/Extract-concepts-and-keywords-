 Activities  Ghana boasts some beautiful sandy beaches and lagoons, though swimming can be dangerous due to riptides and undertows. For a less risky dip, try the pools in Accra's big hotels. Jogging is also popular along the beaches near Accra, though you may have to sidestep human excreta. Beyond the sands, sport fishing for barracuda is popular, and if the fish aren't biting, at least the old seaside forts and villages look spectacular from the sea. The Volta River estuary is another good place to drop a line. Sailing and water-skiing are possible on Lake Volta. The two best spots for surfing are at Fete and Dixcove, both west of Accra. Kakum Nature Park, Owabi Wildlife Sanctuary, Bia National Park, Bui National Park and Mole Game Reserve are all good options for hiking, wildlife watching and exploring the savannahs and rainforests.
