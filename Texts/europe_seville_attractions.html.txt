 Attractions  Seville's immense cathedral, one of the biggest in the world, was built on the site of Muslim Seville's main mosque between 1401 and 1507. The adjoining tower, La Giralda, was the mosque's minaret and dates from the 12th century; climb up for great views. One highlight of the cathedral's lavish interior is Christopher Columbus' supposed tomb inside the south door.
