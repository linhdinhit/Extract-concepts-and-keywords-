 Attractions  The tattered-on-the-edges Old Town was the core of 1890s Portland, and its popularity has returned in recent years as a set for period movies. Despite the best plans of the city elders, Old Town resists gentrification. Missions for the homeless coexist with galleries, fine restaurants and specialty shops.  Rail travelers shouldn't be the only ones to enjoy the beautiful Italianate Union Station. Built in 1890, the spacious marble-walled train station near the corner of NW 6th Ave and Irving St is one of the city's landmarks.  Contiguous with Old Town is Portland's Chinatown. Chinatown Gates, at the corner of NW 4th Ave and Burnside St, announce the old Asian businesses that have thrived in this neighborhood since the 1880s. In addition to a bevy of local-favorite Chinese restaurants, there are scads of gift shops and Asian groceries, and even chinoiserie-topped telephone boxes.
