 Off the Beaten Track  This undeveloped beach of speckled coral sands offers a 30-foot-wide pool protected from the strong Atlantic Ocean currents by a rock shelf that parallels the northside of the shoreline. A new visitor facility has some simple displays on shells, coral and ecology, as well as restrooms. Off the beach are three islands: Sugar Loaf is a privately owned island with a cottage on its south shore; Green Island has a few abandoned buildings and no beach; and Sandy Island has an abandoned hotel and a nice beach for swimming and snorkeling on its leeward side. Bathways Beach can be reached by vehicle along a good road leading northeast from River Sallee, and fishing boats can be chartered from Sauteurs to the islands offshore.
