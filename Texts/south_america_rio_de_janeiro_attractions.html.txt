 Attractions  Going to the beach is a ritual and way of life for the Carioca. People of every color, class and creed, in all shapes and sizes, congregate waterside. One of the world's most famous beaches, Copacabana, hardly needs any introduction - it's the sensuously spectacular, and very crowded, spot of sand fronting the ocean and backed by steep hills. It's where skin sizzles and shines, cameras forever flash, money streamlessly changes hands and excitement rides through the salty sea air.  Copacabana, so big in concept and fantasy, runs just 4.5km (3mi) along the Atlantic, yet crammed into this narrow strip of land are 25,000 people per sq km, one of the highest population densities in the world. There is always something happening on the beach during the day and along the footpaths at night: drinking, singing, eating and all kinds of people checking out the scene. Tourists watch Brazilians, Brazilians watch tourists; the poor from the favelas eye the rich, while the rich avoid the poor; prostitutes look for tricks and johns look for treats.  Southwest of Copacabana is Arpoador, a small beach with good surfing, even at night when the beach is lit. There's a giant rock that juts out into the ocean where you can enjoy a great view.
