 Attractions  The thumping heart of Helsinki is the bustling kauppatori (market square), also known as the fish market. It is surrounded by graceful 19th-century buildings - some of the few remaining in the city after the devastation of WWII. Havis Amanda, the lovely mermaid statue and fountain just west of the fish market, was designed in 1908 by one of Finland's most beloved artists, Ville Vallgren. The statue, also known as 'Manta,' is commonly regarded as the symbol of Helsinki - if not all of Finland.  Across from the kauppatori is the Presidential Palace, originally built in 1814 as the local residence for the Russian czar. It is now the president's official home, though the president is often away on diplomatic missions.
