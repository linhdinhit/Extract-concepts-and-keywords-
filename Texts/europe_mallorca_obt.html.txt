 Off the Beaten Track  If you're after the island's famous pearls, Mallorca's second largest town is the place to come. This industrial city has been cultivating pearls since 1890, and numerous shops here flog the little gems. The best place to get them is the factory on the outskirts of town, where you can take a tour of the manufacturing process before you buy. Don't come looking for a bargain though; artificial pearls, such as those cultivated in Manacor, look very like (and last longer than) the real thing so they can be quite expensive. After your shopping you can refuel with a taste of the local speciality, sobrasada, a spicy sausage. There's not much to see in the town itself (which is pretty unattractive) except the church, Esglesia dels Delors de Nostra Senyora, built on the site of the former mosque.  Manacor is on the C715 road, just inland from Porto Cristo.
