 Environment  Antarctica (where the South Pole is located ) is the fifth-largest continent in the world, around twice the size of Australia. It's the world's most arid continent (technically a desert) and, at an average elevation of 2250m (7380ft), it's also the world's highest. The highest point is the 4897m (16,062ft) Vinson Massif. Recent satellite imaging has established that 99.6% of the continent is covered in ice, and this represents 90% of the world's ice - 30 million cubic km, around 70% of the world's fresh water. The Antarctic Circle is an imaginary line in the Southern Ocean parallel to the equator at a latitude of 66 32' south. Antarctica's nearest continental neighbour is South America, around 1130km (700mi) away from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Considerably further away are the southern tips of the Australian and African continents.  Plant species in Antarctica are far more numerous than you might expect given the region's harsh climate and aridity, but they're all humble little life-forms. There are hundreds of species of algae, around 350 species of lichen, 100 species of moss, two grass species and a pearlwort. There are even some lichens and algae that grow inside rocks - endolithic plants. Of course the subantarctic islands support a much wider variety of flora species with South Georgia alone having at least 50 vascular plants.  The largest of the endemic land-based animal species is a wingless midge ( Belgica antarctica) that grows to just over a centimetre. The rest, all invertebrates, are even smaller. About 45 bird species breed south of the Antarctica Convergence, and just a few of those, mostly penguins and petrels, on the Antarctic continent itself. The Southern Ocean, by contrast, teems with life and supports vast numbers of fish, seal, whale and seabird species.
