 Off the Beaten Track  The historic home of Andrew Jackson, the Hermitage is Nashville's most prized historic-home museum and a monument to the state's most famous political figure. Beginning his national political career as Tennessee's single Representative even before it had officially gained statehood, the fiery tempered Jackson went on to become the 7th US president.  Set among gardens in a wooded urban retreat, the graceful mansion is an amalgamation of its original 1821 Federal style with Pallatian flourishes and Grecian columns added in the 1830s. The big house was once the center of a self-sufficient cotton plantation of 1500 acres worked by 150 slaves. The modern visitor center introduces Jackson's life with a short film.  The Hermitage is about 20 miles (30km) northeast of Nashville, and a car is the best way to reach it.
