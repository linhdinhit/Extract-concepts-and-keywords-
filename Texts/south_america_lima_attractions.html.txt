 Attractions  Lima has more than 50 museums, but most visitors will be restricted to visiting just a handful. In that case make sure you don't miss the Museo de Oro del Peru. This building is actually two museums rolled into one. Its massive Gold Museum will blow you away with thousands of gold pieces, each uniquely sculptured into something different from ear plugs to clothing decorations. This is very high up on most visitors' must-see list. The Arms Museum at the top of the building is one of the world's best with thousands of ancient firearms from all over the world. It's beggars belief that some of these clumsy looking old guns were once quite effective.
