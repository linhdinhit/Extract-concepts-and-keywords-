 When to Go  Stuttgart's climate is milder than the climate in much of Germany, which accounts for the region's wine-growing success. But the winter months (November to March) are still quite chilly, so unless you're headed there for a specific festival, the best times to visit are between June and September. Expect big crowds in August during the Sommerfest and Weindorf, as well as during the Cannstatter Volksfest in September and October.     Events  Stuttgarters are avid music fans, and the year kicks off with the acclaimed Eclat New Music Festival (January/February) devoted to avant-garde composers. Fasnet, the Swabian version of Carnival, revels in its pagan origins, as celebrants dress as witches and ghosts in ancient wooden masks and participate in parades, dances and macabre rituals. The bizarre festivities intensify over six weeks, culminating on the Tuesday before Lent. The Jazzopen Festival in July features popular acts like Dave Brubeck, George Benson and Bebel Gilberto. The Bach Summer Academy, presented by the renowned International Bach Academy under the direction of Helmuth Rilling, draws large crowds of classical music lovers in early September.  Wine lovers descend upon the city during Weindorf, a 10-day celebration in which hundreds of local vintners showcase their wares (late August or early September). The Cannstatter Volksfest (People's Fair) is the event of the year, a 16-day beer festival held late September to early October and second only in size to Munich's Oktoberfest. In addition to copious quantities of beer, the Volksfest features fireworks, carnival rides, oompah music and Swabian specialties like Spätzle and Bretzel. The Christmas Market, which begins the last Thursday in November and runs until December 23, is a winter wonderland of local crafts, choirs, a children's village and hearty food and drink.
