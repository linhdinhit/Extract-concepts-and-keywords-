 When to Go  As in much of Spain, spring (March-May) and October are the best times to be in Madrid. The weather is generally agreeable, the city has a fresh feel to it and it isn't too overrun with tourists. If you love to party, visit during May for Madrid's biggest fiesta. You might like to book ahead though, it's a tough month for tracking down accommodation. From late June until the first weeks of September, the summer heat can be appalling, averaging above 30 C (85 F). The winter months are bitter, with temperatures averaging 2-11 C (36-52 F), though February occasionally produces crisp blue days and temperatures around 17 C (60 F).     Events  Madrid celebrates 14 official holidays a year, including all the major Catholic festivals as well as New Year's Day (1 January), Labour Day (1 May) and Spanish National Day (12 October). The city goes particularly crazy during carnivale (February/March), the Fiesta de la Comunidad de Madrid (2 May) and Fiestas de San Isidro (15 May). There's localised mayhem in June-July when the city's districts celebrate their various saints' days. Offices, banks and some shops close on public holidays, and they often also close on the intervening day if the holiday falls close to a weekend. Madrid is just about evacuated in August, as the locals head off on their holidays, and you may find that some restaurants and shops will be closed for the month.  OK, a picture of Madrid wouldn't be complete without mention of the city's bullfights. Those with the machismo of Hemingway and the sensibilities of Sid Vicious can taste the blood and sand at the Plaza de Toros Monumental de Las Ventas, Madrid's most stylish and important bullfighting ring. The season kicks off in February, and there are small local corridas throughout summer and spring. The main event on the bullfighting calendar is the mid-May feria, the four weeks of bloodletting that are part of the festival of San Isidro.
