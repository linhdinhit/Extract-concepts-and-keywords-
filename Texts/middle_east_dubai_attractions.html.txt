 Attractions  Souqs, Arabic open-air markets, are a classic Dubai experience. They've changed a lot since the Bedouin days, but are still open for business in the early morning and between 5pm and 8pm.  The Deira Covered Souq has more of an Indian feel than an Arabic one, with folks hawking textiles, spices, kitchen wares, clothes and henna. The Spice Souq, also known as the Deira Old Souq (it's not just for spices), sells all sorts of trinkets, clothing, rugs and glassware. The overflowing bags of seasonings are concentrated at the eastern end, closest to Dubai Creek; just follow your nose.  Deira's celebrated Gold Souq, with its intricate wooden lattice archway and windows filled with glittering gold, attracts buyers from throughout the world. Dubai's nickname, the 'City of Gold,' was well earned: any type of gold jewellery, in any color the craftspeople can coax from the metal, can be yours for a price. Next door is the Perfume Souq, with European designer fragrances, cleverly named knock-offs and strong, spicy Arabic scents.  The Electronics Souq is known throughout the region as the place to get the PlayStation of your dreams, and does a roaring business with those who ship the stuff back home and sell it for a tidy profit. The Dubai Souq, in Bur Dubai, has been beautifully rebuilt to appeal to tourists, but sells mostly items appreciated by the Indo-Pakistani expat community. This is the place to purchase that custom-made sari.
