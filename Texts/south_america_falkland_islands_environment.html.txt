 Environment  The Falklands comprise two main islands, East Falkland and West Falkland, plus over 200 smaller islets some 480km (300mi) east of Argentina. Combined, their area is about the same as that of Northern Ireland or the US state of Connecticut. Grassland and shrubs dominate the hilly-to-mountainous landscape, with peat bogs and 'runs' of quartzite boulders breaking up the terrain. There are no native trees. South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, some 1280km (800mi) to 1900km (1200mi) to the east, were the Falklands' dependencies until 1985, when they were constituted as a separate colony of Britain. (They're still administered from Stanley by a civil commissioner who serves concurrently as governor of the Falklands.)  The islands' main draws are its assortment of relatively fearless birds and animals and the bushwalking necessary to see them. In terms of wildlife diversity, only the Everglades and the Gal pagos Islands can compare. If you're coming from the northern hemisphere, chances are good that nearly every creature you see will be new to you, and even if you're not, you won't have seen them in such profusion. The five species of penguin that take up residence on the Falklands between October and March are probably the biggest attraction, but equally impressive are the massive elephant seals, sea lions and other marine mammals that breed on the islands' beaches.
