 Attractions  This is Molokai's biggest town, but it has no shopping malls, and no chain stores. What it does have is a look and feel somewhere between a tropical port and an Old West frontier town and an easy, laid back attitude.  Gone are the days when pineapple was loaded from Kaunakakai Wharf but a commercial barge still uses the harbor once a week and there are mooring facilities for smaller boats. Along the foreshore are some stone foundations, the remains of King Kamehameha V's vacation palace, built in the 1860s. A 15 minute walk west out of town and you can see the King's sacred bathing pools and the Kapuaiwa ('mysterious taboo') Coconut Grove - acres of coconut palms planted for His Majesty. But all in all, the biggest sight in Kaunakaki is a natural one: the fiery red sunset that comes down over the town and the harbor.
