 Activities  Leeds draws people for its shopping and nightlife, as well as its proximity to the 638 sq mi (1,650 sq km) Yorkshire Dales, made famous by the books and television show All Creatures Great and Small. During the summer, the place is full of cyclists, walkers and - further to the west - Bront fans. In the winter, ice skating is a favourite activity at the Ice Cube, in the new Millennium Square. Cricket and football are the local spectator sports to get along to, and if you're in town long enough you might even be able to play a game.
