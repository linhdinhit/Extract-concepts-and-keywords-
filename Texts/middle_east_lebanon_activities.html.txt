 Activities  Lebanon has fabulous trekking opportunities in its mountains and gorges. It's usually a relatively short distance between villages, so planning overnight stops is not a problem if that's the kind of hiking which appeals to you. There are 6 main ski resorts in Lebanon, offering varying degrees of difficulty. Equipment hire is available at all resorts, and the cost is reasonable.  There aren't many sandy beaches on the Lebanese coast; much of the swimming is from rocks or artificial platforms built on jetties. Of the sandy beaches, the best can be found in the far south of the country, just south of Tyre. There are also reasonable beaches near Byblos and at Chekka, near Tripoli. The rocky bathing sites often make good snorkelling spots; water-skiing, windsurfing and sailing are all popular too.
