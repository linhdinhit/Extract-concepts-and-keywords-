 Off the Beaten Track  The first major town north of the Sani Pass, Mokhotlong (Place of the Bald Ibis) has basic shops and transport to Oxbow and Butha-Buthe. The town, 270km (170mi) from Maseru and 200km (125mi) from Butha-Buthe, has the reputation for being the coldest, driest and most remote place in Lesotho. And given the comparative lack of roads and transport, that's really saying something. There are a couple of places to stay, and the town is a good base for walks to the Drakensberg escarpment. Private transport is required to reach Mokhotlong from Maseru.
