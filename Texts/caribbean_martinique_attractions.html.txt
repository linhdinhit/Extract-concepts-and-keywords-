 Attractions  Although it's the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the French West Indies, much of Fort-de-France's charm lies in its natural setting on the edge of the Baie des Flamands, framed by the Pitons du Carbet rising to the north. The city's mix of narrow bustling streets, parks, offices and turn-of-the-century buildings housing boutiques and cafes gives it a flavor owing as much to the sidestreets of Paris as it does to that of the Caribbean.  The city's focus is the Savane, a large park with fountains, tall palms and occasional open-air concerts. The city's other large waterfront space is the Park Floral, where you can shop for coconuts and other island-grown produce at the public market; there's also a fish market nearby.  Fort-de-France's interesting buildings include the Bibliotheque Schoelcher, an elaborate, colorful structure with a Byzantine dome. Designed by architect Henri Pick and built in Paris for the 1889 World Exposition, it was then dismantled, shipped to Fort-de-France and reassembled. Another Pick creation is the Cathedrale Saint-Louis, dating from 1895 and featuring fine stained-glass windows and a massive organ.  Other places worth visiting include the Palais de Justice, a neoclassical 1906 courthouse resembling a French train station; the Musee Departemental d'Archeologie, which has displays on the island's Amerindian past; and the Aquarium de la Martinique, featuring a tropical river habitat.
