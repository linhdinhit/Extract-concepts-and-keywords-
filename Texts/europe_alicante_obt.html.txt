 Off the Beaten Track  Benidorm is not exactly off the beaten track, but, paradoxically, it's becoming so popular that more and more people are choosing not to go there. A sprawling resort city, 40km (25 mi) north of Alicante, Benidorm is a kind of super-disco package-tour concrete high-rise party town, drawing in over five million visitors annually. It offers 130 hotels and more than 5000 apartment spaces, over 600 restaurants and cafes, hundreds more bars and clubs, and only 5km (3mi) of beach to hold multitudes of soon-to-be-badly-sunburnt Northern European tourists. Benidorm's clubs are enormous, with a house and techno scene that almost rivals Ibiza's. There's also a 'Mediterranean' theme fun park, Terra Mitica (Mystery Land); Aquilandia, Europe's largest water fun park; and Mundomar, an animal theme park with, among other things, parrots, dolphins and sea lions.
