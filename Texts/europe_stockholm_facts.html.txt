 When to Go  Most of Sweden has a cool temperate climate, with precipitation in all seasons, but the southern quarter of the country has a warm temperate climate. Sweden is shielded from rainy Atlantic weather systems and can be influenced by high pressure over Russia, giving fine weather instead. Stockholm has an average of about nine hours of sunshine daily from May to July.     Events  The Summer Music Festival, held from late May through August at the Drottningholms Court Theatre, celebrates opera, classical music and ballets by featuring productions that use historical, original instruments.  Each November, the Stockholm International Film Festival offers new filmmakers a competitive forum in which to strut their stuff. A relative newcomer to the scene and one of the few 24-hour film festivals in existence, this event has become one of Europe's most important film competitions.  Foodies should look out for Restaurangernas Dag in early June, when Stockholm's restaurants move into central Kungsträdgården and offer food, drinks and entertainment. The Stockholm Jazz Festival blows through town in mid-July. The gay and lesbian Stockholm Pride event is held in early August.
