 Off the Beaten Track  Sukarara is a noted weaving and basketwork centre, and unusual for its houses built from local stone. It's set in rice-growing country dotted with small thatch-roofed villages, and nearly every house here has an old wooden handloom, not to mention, of course, a traditionally dressed young woman weaving for the benefit of tour groups. Most of the material is actually made in homes in the surrounding villages, and there's such a wide variety of size, quality and style that it's impossible to give a rough guide to prices. The best pieces, however, are excellent, and well worth the price tag. Penujak, just to the south of Sukarara, is well known for its pottery made from the local red clay and fired in traditional kilns.
