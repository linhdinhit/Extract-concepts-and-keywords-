 Activities  Although lying motionless in worship to the sun - regularly fortified by rum cocktails - is one very attractive holidaying option, St Martin offers a surfeit of more energetic activities. There's swimming at a myriad of gorgeous beaches, from busy clothing-optional Orient Beach and secluded Long Beach to swimming-snorkelling beaches such as Baie Rouge and the islets off the northeast coast.  Serious divers spend their time on more southerly islands such as St Lucia and St Vincent & the Grenadines, but everyone else should find some decent local diving across the border at Dutch Sint Maarten's Proselyte Reef. If you prefer a snorkel mask to an oxygen tank you'll find Baie Rouge and the islands of Green Cay and let Pinel the perfect spots for snorkelling. For some of the Eastern Caribbean's best windsurfing point your sail at Orient Bay and the north end of Baie de I'Embouchure.  If you don't want to get wet, try hiking around the island; the most popular route winds up to Pic Paradis, St Martin's highest point. Golf is also on offer for landlubbers, but you'll need to travel across to Mullet Beach in Sint Maarten - well worth the trip if you like the idea of teeing off among palm trees and the deep-blue water of the Caribbean. If you really want to live out the beach fantasy, saddle up for some horseriding along Orient Beach, Baie Lucas or Anse Marcel.
