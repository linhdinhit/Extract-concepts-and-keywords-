 Activities  Most of Haiti's good beaches are north of Port-au-Prince and northwest of Cap-Ha tien. If you'd rather stay underwater, be sure to check out the diving. The beaches are surrounded by coral reefs that took their toll on ships lost by the Dutch, French and Spanish during the 17th and 18th centuries. At Amani, near St Marc, divers descend the famous Zombie Hole, a 200m-deep hole that is home to what is believed to be the world's largest sea sponge, the Elephant's Ear. Near the coast of La Gon ve is a spectacular wall covered with black coral.   Hiking is also popular, particularly in Macaya and La Visite national parks. Cloud forests, alpine meadows, waterfalls and complex limestone cave systems all await exploration. There are also a few places that offer horseback riding, but ask to inspect the horses before making a commitment.  Wherever brushy undercover or remnant forests survive, bird watching is likely to be rewarding. Flamingos, herons, ibises and many species of duck make their homes on the water, while more flamboyant Hispaniolan parakeets, golden swallows and Antillean siskins are common wherever there are pine trees. Several species of hummingbirds make their homes here as well; bring binoculars.
