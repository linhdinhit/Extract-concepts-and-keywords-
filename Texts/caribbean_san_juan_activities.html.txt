 Activities  The best beaches in San Juan are at Isla Verde and Condado, both backed by a fortress wall of high rises. If you want to get out of the city (though not away from the crowds) try picturesque Luquillo, 30km (19mi) east of the capital, which is backed by nothing more intrusive than palm trees. Water babies can also try windsurfing in the sheltered waters of Condado Lagoon or deep-sea fishing for marlin, tuna and sailfish in the waters off San Juan. The more sedate sport of kite flying is popular on the grassy, breezy slopes surrounding El Morro, said to be the world's best kite site.
