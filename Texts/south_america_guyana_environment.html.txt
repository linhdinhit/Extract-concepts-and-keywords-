 Environment  Roughly the size of the UK, Guyana is bordered by Venezuela to the west, Suriname to the east, and overshadowed by Brazil to the south. Its northern coast abuts the Atlantic Ocean. The country's most prominent geological feature is the Guiana Shield, a vast crystalline upland north of the R o Solim es, the Amazon's major channel. From Mt Roraima (2772m/9092ft), on the Brazilian border, the shield recedes in steps all the way to the coast. Thick rainforest covers great chunks of the interior, though southwestern Guyana features extensive grassland. About 90% of the population lives on the agriculturally rich coastal plain.  Guyana's varied and spectacular wildlife includes brightly-plumed birds and mammals such as tapirs, ocelots and monkeys. The equatorial climate results in high temperatures, tempered by cooling sea breezes. There are two rainy seasons: from May to mid-August and from mid-November to mid-January.  The interior regions, which were never dominated by Europeans, retain some of the world's best remaining tropical forests, although these ecosystems are constantly threatened by both uncontrolled gold-mining and logging by multinational timber companies.  The US Trade and Development Agency and a US firm are conducting a feasibility study for a US$180,000 hydroelectric plant at Amaila Falls. The projected power plant, about 193km (120mi) north of Kaieteur Falls, would supply the national grid and other users with energy.
