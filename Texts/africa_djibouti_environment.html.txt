 Environment  Djibouti is a little bigger than El Salvador but nowhere near as green; it is mostly a hot desert waste with virtually no arable land. Vaguely foetus-shaped, you can divide it into three regions to make sense of its geography: the coastal plain, the volcanic plateaus in the south and centre, and the mountain ranges up north. It shares borders with Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia on the Horn of Africa, and you can make out the coast of Yemen across the waves of the Red Sea.  Lac Abbe is where you'll see flamingoes feeding in the mornings, and while it's not designated as a national park it's one of the few places where you will see wildlife of any kind. When you consider Djibouti's weather, 'torrid' and 'dry' come quickly to mind. It's too hot and there's too little water anywhere to support much more than the odd nomad's camel. The cooler season, which sometimes brings rain, averages 25 C (77 F), but at the peak of the hot season the mercury nudges 45 C (113 C).
