 Off the Beaten Track  This is the most isolated and unspoiled beach close to the city. With mountains and natural vegetation, this beautiful setting is quiet during the week, but packed on weekends with Cariocas looking to get away from the city-beach chaos. Part of this stretch (4km/2.5mi) has been set aside as an Environmental Protection Area, which should stop it from becoming more cheesecake for the rich. Cinema buffs should note that scenes from the movie Blame it on Rio were filmed here.  Other beaches down south include Recreio, Prainha and Marambaia, which are all very beautiful and worth exploring. They are not easily accessible by public transportation and only get busy on the weekends. Prainha is one of the best surfing beaches in Rio.
