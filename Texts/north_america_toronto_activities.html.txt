 Activities  Toronto is built for walking. The two-hour Humber River Discovery Walk offers an interesting route, while true outdoor enthusiasts will enjoy the Don River Valley ravine walk. Just east of the Beach neighborhood, Scarborough Bluffs has several parks with paths leading down to the lake and up to sweeping views. Free public swimming pools are found throughout the city, and there are sandy beaches and shady parks at The Beaches, about 8km (5mi) east of downtown, at Sunnyside Beach, about 8km (5mi) west and on Centre Island. Windsurfing and sailing are both popular on Lake Ontario.  Toronto also has some great places for bicycle riding and in-line skating. The Martin Goodman Trail along the waterfront is especially worthwhile, passing the Harbourfront and the downtown area on its way to the Humber River in the west. If you feel the need to push yourself, the Martin Goodman Trail links up with the Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail, which stretches 325km (200mi) from Hamilton to Trenton. High Park and the Toronto Islands are other convenient places to cycle and in-line skate.  Excellent golfing can be had on the first ever Jack Nicklaus-designed course, in the suburb of Oakville. In winter, there are good, free places for ice-skating at City Hall, the Harbourfront and Grenadier Pond in High Park, about 8km (5mi) west of downtown.
