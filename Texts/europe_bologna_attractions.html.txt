 Attractions  At the centre of the oldest part of Bologna, the broad open spaces of the Piazza Maggiore and the adjoining Piazza del Nettuno are surrounded by some of the city's most impressive medieval and Renaissance buildings and monuments. But these huge pedestrian squares are not rarefied, contemplative places; in the midst of all the splendour you'll see hundreds of busy Bolognesi carrying on with their everyday business, meeting in cafes, and crowding around the many musicians and street performers.  The wide street connecting the two piazzas is graced by an enormous fountain, the Fontana del Nettuno. The fountain, built in 1566, has bronze statuary by a Flemish sculptor, Jean Boulogne de Douai, who became so famous for the job he was nicknamed 'Giambologna'. A massive figure of Neptune stands on top of the fountain, trident in hand. Neptune is attended by four angels, symbolising the four winds, and four sirens - gleefully watching water spouting from their own breasts - representing the four continents known to the Renaissance world.  On the western side of the two piazzas is Bologna's town hall, the Palazzo Comunale. Its grandiose central staircase, attributed to the Renaissance architect Donato Bramante, was built wide enough for horse drawn carriages to transport their noble occupants up to the first floor. The palazzo houses an extensive collection of medieval and Renaissance paintings, sculpture and furniture. Outside the Palazzo you'll see a huge panel covered with photographs of Italian partisans killed during the WWII; such displays are common in the region of Emilia-Romagna, which was a centre of fierce partisan resistance to the German Occupation.
