 Off the Beaten Track  Gombad-e Kavus is a spectacular tomb tower, a stunning memorial to the remarkable Ghabus (of which 'Kavus' is a corruption), a prince, poet, scholar, general and patron of the arts. He ruled the surrounding region at the turn of the 11th century and decided to build a monument to last forever. The 55m (180ft) tower was completed in 1006, six years before Ghabus was slain by an assassin.  Gombad is 93km (58mi) north-east from Gorgan, a sizeable town in northern Iran near the Caspian Sea. Minibuses leave about every hour from the special Gombad terminal. There's also a daily bus from Tehran, 470km (290mi) south-east of Gombad.
