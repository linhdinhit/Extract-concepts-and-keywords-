 Off the Beaten Track  A pleasant day trip from Oslo, this charming town contains numerous clapboard timber buildings. Santa Claus apparently calls Drøbak home and has his own post office here. You can send Christmas cards with the official Santa stamp 365 days of the year from here. The town has a Christmas theme pretty much all year round. Drøbak is mainly a summer hideaway for Oslo residents, but there are a few things for tourists to do here. The Oscarsborg fortress was built in 1845 and sits on a small island in the fjord. Shots fired from here sunk the German warship Blücher in 1940. Most of Drøbak overlooks the fortress. Other things to pass time in Drøbak are a visit to the Saltvannsakvarium aquarium and a small maritime museum containing a number of boat engines. The town also claims to have one of the highest proportions of art galleries per capita in Europe and, if you can't stand the thought of being without your golf clubs for more than a few days, there's an 18-hole golf course. Drøbak is an hour's bus ride south of Oslo.
