 Off the Beaten Track  Niue's territorial waters encompass three outlying reefs: Beveridge, Antiope and Haran. Beveridge is a fabled diving spot, a mere 16-hour (300km/186mi) sail away from Niue to the southeast. Visited only by the occasional cruising yacht, the reef has a pristine 5km (3mi) stretch of whiter-than-white sand, topped by the wreck of an old tuna fishing boat lying high and dry. The lagoon is deep, open and sailable; the corals and sealife are vibrant; and the sharks are numerous, so dangle those toes with care.
