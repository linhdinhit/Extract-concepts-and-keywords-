 Activities  Fort Lauderdale offers over 20 miles (32km) of Atlantic coast, perfect for snorkeling or diving. There are tons of dive shops along the beach, which can point you toward the reefs and wrecks. Pompano Beach, about 10 miles (16km) north of Fort Lauderdale, has some challenges for experienced divers. Water skiing is possible on the ocean, but equipment rental is usually outrageously expensive. You can fish in the Intracoastal Waterway; a particularly pleasant spot is from Hugh Taylor Birch State Recreation Area. The recreation area is also a good place to head to hike and camp. Outside of the ocean, there's no better place to swim in all of Fort Lauderdale than the Aquatic Complex at the International Swimming Hall of Fame. For an otherworldly experience, go on a swim with the dolphins trip to the Florida Keys; tour operators leave from Fort Lauderdale.
