 Attractions  The most popular of the town's beaches is definitely Medano - its calm waters are perfect for swimming, though you might have to dodge the odd jet ski. The souvenir vendors have worked out that this is the best beach to hawk Day of the Dead dolls, but there are plenty of bars and restaurants in which to give them the slip. This area is definitely the party place in town, so if you're after peace and tranquility make for the quieter stretch of sand beyond the Club Cascadas.  If you're looking for adventure sports action this should be your first stop: you can carve up the coast on a windsurfer, jump into a sea kayak, strap yourself into a parasail for an adrenalin-racing eyeful of the coastline or try the heart-stopping, but picturesque, beachside bungee jumping. And of course there's always terrorizing swimmers with a jet ski. All the water sports toys are available for hire at various places along the beach.
