 Activities  If it involves water, frozen or not, you'll find scores of enthusiasts doing it in the Netherlands. Other activities aided by flat land - biking and walking - are naturals and part of the national image. Cycling is, in fact, the most popular activity in the country, helped along by dedicated bike lanes and paths, guarded parking areas and road rules that increasingly favour cyclists over cars. The smooth cycle paths are also used a lot by in-line skaters. Windsurfing and sailing have a lot of fans in the waterlogged provinces of Friesland and Zeeland. If it's cold enough in winter it's possible to make long ice-skating tours from town to town along connecting canals. Wadlopen is a serious pastime - strenuous and at times dangerous - involving long low-tide walks in mud that can come up to your thighs. Yes, people really do this. Groningen, in the north, is the best place to organise your mud-walking excursion.
