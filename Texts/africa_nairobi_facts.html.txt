 When to Go  The best times to visit are during January and February and between June and October, when the weather is drier in and around Nairobi. Because Nairobi is located at the edge of the highlands, temperatures are cooler here compared with much of the rest of the country.     Events  The Nairobi agricultural show is held in the first week of October and is attended by local tribes people. Apart from this, there are celebrations during national holidays that include: Madaraka Day (1 June), which celebrates self government, Kenyatta Day (20 October) and Independence Day (12 December).
