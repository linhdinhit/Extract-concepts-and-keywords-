 When to Go  Budapest averages 2000 hours of sunshine a year, among the highest in Europe. Although we're not sure who measured this, it means there are opportunities to visit Budapest throughout the year in reasonably fine weather and avoid the madness and expense of Europe's high season. Both spring and autumn are glorious in Budapest, with plenty to see and do, and the winter cold doesn't really hit until mid-December when many museums and tourist sights close. However, even in winter there are occasionally spectacular blue skies. Summer can be hot and lazy, perfect for soaking up a Dreher (Hungary's local beer) at a hip outdoor cafe or any of the myriad festivals occurring around town.     Events  Budapest is a cultural Mecca and has a long tradition celebrating its chequered history; each of the four seasons has its own festivals. Budapest Farewell is a fervent masquerade party held at several open-air venues around Budapest and celebrates the last Russian soldiers' departure from Hungary in 1991. The Jewish Summer Festival and International Wine Festival showcase the richness of Budapest's history, art and culture in venues throughout the city. The Budafest Summer Opera & Ballet Festival provides the opportunity to see some of the world's finest high culture in Budapest's amazing Opera House at very affordable prices. Not to be missed.  If the classics are not your thing, join the frenzied throng on buda Island - an old disused shipyard - at the Pepsi Island multicultural youth festival, home to central Europe's highest concentration of the 'mullet' hairstyle, moshing and doofing it with the best of the west. Proudly brought to you by Hungary's beverage provider of choice (just don't mention the `other' brand). Hungary's premier sporting event is the Hungarian Formula One Grand Prix held in mid-August each year.
