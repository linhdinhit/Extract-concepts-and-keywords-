 Off the Beaten Track  The pretty, lively town of Trashigang is a good jumping-off point to visit the kingdom's wild east. Few travellers make it here but, as long as you're happy to leave behind the relative comforts of Thimphu and Paro, exploring this neck of the woods can have its rewards. This is the most densely populated part of Bhutan but also most definitely the hinterland.  Locals are fond of a tipple, and bodies sleeping off their excesses at the side of the road aren't an unusual sight. On the street leading toward the dzong, you'll find the Gyeltshen Bar open every day. The sign says 'bar' and has a picture of a cowboy on one side and a local artist's peculiar adaptation of Donald Duck on the other. This is a good place to sample the local arra and soak up the atmosphere (in that order). Villagers come to town on holy days, which occur on the first, 10th and 15th of the Bhutanese month. After selling their produce they get stuck into the arra and paint the town an unforgettable Bhutanese shade of red.  Be warned! Local Jeep drivers say that if you leave Trashigang at 3.30am, you won't be reaching Thimphu before 8.30pm; a gruelling 17 hour, 600km (192mi) endurance trial up hill and down dale.
