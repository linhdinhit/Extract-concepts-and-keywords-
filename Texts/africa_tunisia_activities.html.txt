 Activities  Tunisia's best beaches are in the north around Ghar el-Melh, Tabarka and Bizerte - much better than the crowded ones at the resorts. The beaches farther south look good on paper, but they're not so great for swimming. The best of that lot is at Aghir.  Tunisia is just waking up to the possibility of trekking. The forest of the Kroumirie Mountains around 'Ain Draham have enormous potential, but decent maps have yet to be drawn. More popular right now, camel trekking is best arranged out of Zaafrane, 12km (8mi) south-west of Douz, where you can arrange anything from an hour's ride to an eight-day oasis hop. If this hooks you on the desert's charms, dune skiing and land yachting can be arranged in certain areas.   Bird watching is popular in Tunisia, although the country has relatively few resident species. It's an important stopover for migratory birds, making spring and autumn the best times to go. Ichkeul National Park in the north is a prime site.   Ballooning and hydroplane flights are two relatively new options for getting above it all that can be arranged from Tozeur and Aghir, respectively.
