 Off the Beaten Track  Kirishima, in southern Kyushu, is known for its superb mountain scenery, hot springs, the impressive Senriga-taki Waterfall and spring wildflowers. The day walk from Ebino-kogen Village to the summits of a string of volcanoes is one of the finest volcanic hikes in Japan. Shorter walks include a stroll around a series of volcanic lakes - Lake Rokkannon has the most intense colour, a deep blue-green. The southern view from the summit of Mt Karakuni-dake is superb: on a clear day you can see right down to Kagoshima, the nearest large city, and the smoking cone of Sakurajima, a decidedly overactive volcano. A direct bus runs from Kagoshima to Ebino-kogen.
