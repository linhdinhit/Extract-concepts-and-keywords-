 When to Go  Spring (September to November) and autumn (March to May) are the best times to visit, as Perth experiences hot, dry summers and mild, but rainy, winters. One peculiarity of the local weather is the breeze that blows in from the sea in the late afternoon - call it the 'Fremantle Doctor', and you might as well wear a t-shirt saying 'I'm not from around here'.     Events  Every year around February/March the Festival of Perth offers entertainment in the form of music, drama, dance, visual art and films. The Northbridge Festival is hosted at the same time. In early June, West Week is held to celebrate WA's foundation - there are historical re-enactments, arts and crafts exhibitions, concerts and sporting events. The Perth Royal Show takes place every September while the Artrage Festival is in October.
