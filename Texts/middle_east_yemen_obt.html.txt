 Off the Beaten Track  Once the capital of the kingdom of Ma'in, Barqish stands beside a wadi in the north of Yemen. The city was a thriving centre for a few decades around 400BC; it had huge city walls, punctuated by dozens of impressive watchtowers, which surrounded a tightly built urban settlement.  There's not a lot left of Barqish these days - you can still see the city wall, but the rest of the city is deserted and ruined. Old stones with Minaean inscriptions have been used as patches on the city wall, and you'll find the ruins of a mosque and a temple in the centre of the town.  Baraqish is about 100km (60mi) north-east of San'a. There's no public transport between the two cities, so you'll need to take a tour or hire a taxi in Ma'rib, the closest big town.
