 Off the Beaten Track  About an hour inland from the Costa del Sol, the stunning town of Ronda straddles the 100m-deep (328ft) El Tajo gorge, with the old Muslim town (La Ciudad) and the newer town (El Mercadillo) connected by three bridges. One of them, the magnificent Puente Nuevo (New Bridge), is 200 years old. The steep cliffs and views of the stunning Serran a de Ronda make for a striking setting, and the historic town attracts many day-trippers from the coast. If you want to stay, most hotels and restaurants are in the newer town.  There's a lot to see within Ronda. Visitors can act macho in one of the oldest bullrings in Spain, Plaza de Toros (opened in 1785), and check out red flags and costumes in the Museo Taurino. The Palacio de Mondrag n, once home to Fernando and Isabel, has a superb Islamic courtyard with clifftop garden. Those feeling energetic can climb down La Mina, 200 steps cut into the side of the cliff (don't forget - you have to come up again).
