 Off the Beaten Track  Over 1.5 million people 'Remember Pearl Harbor' every year by visiting the USS Arizona Memorial, still responding to the rallying cry that ushered the US into WWII. The 185ft (55m) floating memorial perches directly over the Arizona, still lying in the shallow waters where it was sunk by Japanese fighter planes on 7 December 1941. The massive warship took a direct hit in the early morning fighting and sank within 9 minutes, taking with it 1177 sailors.  Today, the memorial is run by the National Parks Service, which maintains the onshore visitors center and its museum and theater. The park service's 75 minute program includes a documentary film on the attack, followed by a boat ride to the memorial. Everything is free.  The Arizona Memorial visitors center is off Hwy 99 (Kamehameha Hwy) on the Pearl Harbor Naval Base, about 9 miles (15km) west of Honolulu via H-1. Shuttle buses run from all the major Waikiki hotels.
