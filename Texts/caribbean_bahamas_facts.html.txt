Incessant trade breezes ensure pleasant temperatures, so unless you're visiting the southern isles, which get infernally hot in summer (June to August), weather isn't a major factor in determining when to go. The best time to come is the warm, breezy summer, when the water is so warm you can linger in it for hours. Mid-winter temperatures in the northerly and westerly isles can be surprisingly cold. In summer, the rainy season extends from May to November, when hurricanes are a slim possibility. The so-called 'peak season' runs from mid-December to mid-April, when hotel prices are highest.     Events   Junkanoo, the nation's most famous festival, has been called 'the centerpiece of Bahamian culture.' The event is hosted at various venues around Christmas and New Year, when streets and settlements resound with cowbells, whistles and goatskin 'goombay' drums, drawing in thousands of foreign visitors. Mostly it's a big blow-out for the locals. The main festivity begins before sunrise on Bay St in Nassau on December 26. As many as 20,000 locals and tourists party the night away.  The Caribbean Muzik Fest is a week-long jam in late May or early June with reggae, soca, junkanoo and dance hall under the same billing, featuring the best of the Caribbean's musical talent. Pomp and ceremony occur quarterly in Rawson Square in downtown Nassau, with the opening of the Supreme Court. It features the Royal Bahamas Police Band.
