 Attractions  The Chadian capital was known as Fort-Lamy until 1973, and before the civil war was known as one of the nicest cities in the Sahel. Slowly, this reputation is returning, not least because the people are among the most friendly in Africa. This rapidly growing, rapidly modernising city offers great markets, interesting artisan goods and a thriving live music and bar scene. If the prices were a little cheaper and the police weren't shooting people in the street, it'd be almost perfect.  The city is divided into two sections, the European or administrative section and the bigger, more lively African section. Places of interest include the remaining exhibits in the Musee National and the vast Grand Marche. You might also catch the horseracing at the hippodrome on the weekend or even play a round of golf about 4km (2.5mi) east of town.
