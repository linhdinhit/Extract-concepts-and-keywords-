 Attractions  Little more than a village, Vaduz contains most of the points of interest in Liechtenstein. Two adjoining streets, Städtle and Äulestrasse, enclose the centre of town, and everything of any importance is within this small area. The State Art Collection (Staatliche Kunstsammlung) has good temporary exhibitions and includes parts of the art collection that the princes of Liechtenstein have acquired over the centuries. The Postage Stamp Museum contains more than 300 frames of stamps issued since 1912. For ski buffs there's even a Ski Museum, open only in the afternoons.  Although the castle is not open to the public, it is worth climbing up the hill for a closer look. There's a good view of Vaduz and the mountains, as well as a network of marked walking trails along the ridge. The National Museum (Landesmuseum) has coins, weapons, folklore exhibits and an informative slide show of the history of Liechtenstein.  There is a hostel in town as well as a few mid-priced hotels. Restaurants are expensive in Vaduz but there are some good choices - keep an eye out for lunchtime specials.
