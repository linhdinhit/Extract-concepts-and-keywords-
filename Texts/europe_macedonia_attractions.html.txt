 Attractions  Macedonia's capital, Skopje, is strategically set on the Vardar River at a crossroads of Balkan routes almost exactly midway between Tirana and Sofia, capitals of neighbouring Albania and Bulgaria. Thessaloniki, Greece, is 260km (160mi) south-east, near the point where the Vardar flows into the Aegean. The Romans recognised the location's importance long ago when they made the city (which they called Scupi) the centre of Dardania Province. Later conquerors included the Slavs, Byzantines, Bulgarians, Normans and Serbs, until the Turks arrived in 1392 and managed to hold onto Skopje until 1912.  After a devastating earthquake in 1963 killed 1066 people, aid poured in from the rest of Yugoslavia to create the modern urban landscape seen there today. It's evident that the planners got carried away by the money being thrown their way, erecting oversized, irrelevant structures which are now crumbling because of lack of maintenance. The post office building and telecommunications complex next to it are particularly glaring examples of architectural overkill.  Most of central Skopje is a pedestrian zone, with the 15th-century Turkish stone bridge over the Vardar River linking the old and new towns. North from the bridge are the Daud Pasha Baths, dating back to 1466, once the largest Turkish baths in the Balkans. The City Art Gallery now occupies its six domed rooms. North again is the old market area and the tiny Church of Sveti Spas with a finely carved iconostasis done in 1824. It's half buried because when it was constructed in the 17th century no church was allowed to be higher than a mosque.  Also near the old market area, the Museum of Macedonia has a large collection that covers the history of the region. The museum is housed in the modern white building behind the Kursumli Han, a caravanserai, or inn used by traders during the Turkish period. Skopje's old Oriental bazaar district is the largest and most colourful of its kind left in Europe.
