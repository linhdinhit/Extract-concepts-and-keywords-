 Activities  There are several long-distance pedestrian/cycle routes that originate in Glasgow and follow off-road routes for most of the distance. The Tourist Information Centre has a range of maps and leaflets detailing these routes, most of which start from Bell's Bridge. The long-distance footpath known as the West Highland Way begins in Milngavie, 13km (8mi) north of Glasgow, and runs for 153km (95mi) to Fort William.
