 Off the Beaten Track  This vast, inaccessible region in northeastern Honduras is inhabited by small groups of Miskito, Paya and Sumo Indians. Travelers are attracted by the pristine wilderness and abundant wildlife, including manatees, monkeys, alligators and fine bird life. Infrastructure is nonexistent, so be prepared to rough it, carry in food supplies and eat with local families. Attractions include the magnificent R o Pl tano Nature Reserve and boat trips on the rivers and lagoons.
