 Activities  The islands aren't famous for their beaches, but there are a few strands on St Kitts and a couple on Nevis that can make for good walking, picnicking or loafing. St Kitts' best beaches are on the southern end of the island at Frigate Bay and in the sheltered bays along the southeastern peninsula. Beaches along the main body of the island are mostly thin strands of black and gray sands. Running north from Charlestown on Nevis is Pinney's Beach, a long, lovely strand backed by coconut palms. There's also a good white-sand beach on Nevis' northern shore in Newcastle and at Oualie Bay in the northwestern corner of the island.  Despite its limited beaches, St Kitts has healthy reefs and marine life that includes rays, barracuda, garden eels, nurse sharks, sea turtles, sea fans, giant barrel sponges and black coral. A favorite place for snorkeling is White House Bay on St Kitts' southeastern peninsula. A popular scuba dive spot is Sandy Point Bay, below Brimstone Hill, which has an array of corals, sponges and reef fish as well as some coral-encrusted anchors from the colonial era. Among a handful of wreck dives in the bay is the 148ft (45m) freighter River Taw, which sank in 50ft (15m) of water in 1985. Nevis has good diving off its western coast, while Oualie Bay in the north catches the tradewinds and offers windsurfing in shallow waters that's good for beginners; when the wind is up there are also opportunities for wave jumping.  There's some good hiking on the islands, but the tracks into the interior of St Kitts and Nevis are not well defined, so it's advisable to do any major trekking with a guide. Guided hikes are available into the rainforests and estate ruins of St Kitts and up the slopes of Nevis Peak. If you want more speed you can rent a mountain bike on Nevis and do several laps around the island before the sun sets.
