 Attractions  The capital is a picturesque little town on the north-east coast of the main island. Nestled on a bay, it is full of badly neglected Portuguese colonial buildings but superbly maintained parks and gardens. The town centre is small enough to negotiate on foot in a couple of hours. Worth seeing are the 16th century cathedral, and the National Museum in the 400 year-old Fort S o Sebasti o on the peninsula, about 1.2km (.7mi) from the centre of town. It has a good range of displays on agriculture, religion, handcrafts and juju, and a hard hitting display on the slave trade. You should also not miss the Agustinho Neto Manor House, with more than 30 rooms behind one facade. The old Santo Antonio Quarter is fascinating to walk around and it reveals some of the island's history.  There is a limited number of reasonable hotels and pens os around the centre of town, some of them clean and family run. The best place for street food is around the market, where you can find cheap bread rolls stuffed with canned salami or sausages from Portugal. Several restaurants offer good, Portuguese-inspired meals for as little as US$3.
