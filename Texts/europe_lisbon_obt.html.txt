 Off the Beaten Track  Queen of the attractions away from Lisbon is Sintra. This UNESCO World Heritage Site - a 45-minute train trip from Lisbon's Rossio station - is a fairytale destination. It even comes recommended by the estimable Lord Byron (who had few nice things to say about the rest of Portugal).  Top of the list is the Pal cio Nacional da Pena, a mad, Disney-style folly built by King Ferdinand in the 19th century. Escape the crowds and take the leisurely forest walk up to the palace from Sintra's Church of Santa Maria. Clamber around the overgrown ruins of the peaceful Castelo dos Mouros (Moorish castle) and enjoy panoramic views as you walk along its stone battlements to the palace. Once you've been dazed and confused by the bizarre Bavarian-Manueline confection of turrets, battlements and excessive decoration, rest your eyes in the enchanting Pena Park below, from where you can walk back into town. Once you've recovered, tackle the other palace, the Pal cio Nacional de Sintra, in the heart of the old town.
