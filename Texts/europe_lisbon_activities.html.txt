 Activities  When in Rome - well, when in a city that has Roman ruins - do as the locals do: Eat, drink and be merry. Soccer aside, exertion in the name of fitness doesn't rate all that highly among the food-and-wine-loving Lisbo tas. If you really must indulge your sporting side, you will find swimming, golf, tennis and even the pseudo 'sport' of ten-pin bowling available to you.  If you're keen to go swimming but can't make it out to the beach, most of the top hotels have their own pools, while the handiest swimming pool is the small rooftop Ateneu Comercial Complexo de Piscinas.  With six major golf courses in the area, those who wish to spoil a good walk are well catered for.  River cruises and guided walks are other activities that needn't necessarily prove too much of a cardiovascular strain.
