 Off the Beaten Track   This 8-acre (3.2-hectare) apple orchard has evolved into a world-renowned bronze casting facility and sculpture showplace. Every Saturday, you can watch 2000 F (1093 C) molten bronze being poured into ceramic shell molds, one of several steps in the complex lost-wax casting technique. The artists practice mold-making and sand-casting on the premises as well, and are happy to explain the processes and answer questions. A gallery hosts changing exhibits and there is a year-round sculpture garden on the lawn.  The foundry is 5mi(8km) north of Santa Fe on Bishop's Lodge Road in Tesuque.
