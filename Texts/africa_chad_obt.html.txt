 Off the Beaten Track  About 1100km (680mi) from the capital, Fada is a small oasis town with around 5000 inhabitants. It's a modest town nestled in a beautiful area with weird rock formations and several fascinating grottos containing cave paintings, most over 5000 years old. The famous Guelta d'Archei geological formation is about 80km (50mi) from town. Hitching with trucks can take anywhere from three to five days, but saves you the hassle of finding a guide (best done in Kouba) and working your own way there. If you approach Fada from Abeche, you'll pass Libyan tanks rusting by the side of the road.
