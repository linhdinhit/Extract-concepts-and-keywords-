 Activities  For outdoor recreation, residents head primarily to Rock Creek Park and the C&O Canal, both in northwestern Washington. There are well marked hiking and jogging tracks ranging from easy to strenuous in both parks. There's canoeing on the C&O Canal and other boating activities on the Potomac River.  A 10mi (16km) paved cycle path runs from below the Kennedy Center to Pierce Mill, largely along the wooded creek in Rock Creek Park. The C&O Canal towpath makes a great bike route, particularly for mountain bikes - it starts in Georgetown and stretches 184 miles (296km) into Maryland. Washington has more than 40 free public swimming pools to choose from; the one in Georgetown is among the best. When the ice is thick enough, you can ice skate on the C&O Canal. If you don't fancy this, try the small Sculpture Garden Ice Rink on the Mall.
