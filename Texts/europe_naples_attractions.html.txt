 Attractions  This grand cathedral was built on the site of earlier churches, which were themselves preceded by a temple to the pre-Christian god Neptune. Construction of the cathedral kicked off in 1272 under Charles I of Anjou, but the building was largely destroyed in 1456 by an earthquake and has undergone numerous alterations. The neogothic facade is the result of cosmetic surgery in the late 19th century. Inside, above the wide central nave, is an ornately decorated coffered ceiling.  Central to Naples' religious (or superstitious) life is the 17th-century Baroque Cappella di San Gennaro, to the right and down the south aisle after you enter the building. Within the chapel, stowed behind the elaborately carved high altar, are the skull and a couple of phials of the congealed blood of San Gennaro, the city's patron saint. He was martyred at Pozzuoli, west of Naples in AD 305 and tradition holds that these phials of his blood liquefied when his body was transferred back to Naples. Three times a year, thousands gather here to pray for a miracle - that the blood will again liquefy and save Naples from any potential disaster. The saint is said to have saved the city from calamity on numerous occasions - although the miracle unspectacularly failed to occur in 1941 when Vesuvius erupted.
