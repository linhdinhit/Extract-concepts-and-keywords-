 Attractions  The small undistinguished capital of Basseterre sits on the edge of a wide bay backed by green hills, and is home to nearly half the population of St Kitts. The city's name, which means 'lowland', is one of the few remaining traces of French settlement on the island. The dominant European influence in Basseterre, however, is overwhelmingly British, reflected in the buildings and even the layout of its streets. In a fit of anglophilic urban planning, Basseterre added a traffic roundabout and called it the Circus. While no one could mistake it for Piccadilly, the gridlock might seem familiar.  Although most of Basseterre's historic buildings perished in a fire in 1867, there are a fair number of Victorian stone block buildings topped by wooden second stories decorated with fancy latticework and gingerbread trim. Independence Square is a small public park with a central water fountain; its earlier role as the city's slave market is a reminder of the island's harsh colonial past. Flanking the square is the twin-towered Immaculate Conception Cathedral, dating from 1927. Some of the city's history can be seen at the St Christopher Heritage Society which displays historic photos, Amerindian conch-shell tools and pottery shards.
