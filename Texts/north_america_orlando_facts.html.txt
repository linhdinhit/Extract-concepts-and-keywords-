 When to Go  Orlando is popular year round. January is the coldest month, if you consider a low of 50 F (10 C) and a high around 70 F (22 C) cold. July and August are very hot and humid, with highs around 90 F (33 C), 95% humidity and frequent downpours. This is also when kids are out of school for summer vacation, which leads to long, sweaty queues at the theme parks. Weather-wise, early autumn is best. At the theme parks, weekends tend to be less crowded than the beginning of the week. As far as accommodations go, the cheapest time to visit is from early August to mid-December; the most expensive is during the Christmas and Easter holiday periods.     Events  Orlando's festivals are not exactly major league, though it must be hard to organize a brouhaha in the shadow of a theme park that wants you to believe that every day's a holiday. The Silver Spurs Rodeo has been putting on a fine show since 1944, drawing 50,000 spectators and some of the top rodeo athletes to Orlando in mid-February and again in July. It's the largest rodeo in the eastern US.   EPCOT International Flower & Garden Festival is a big to-do at Disney World in mid to late April. The highlight of October is the Oldsmobile Scramble, when 100,000 amateur golfers putt it out at the Walt Disney World Resort. The Oldsmobile Classic for pros follows.
