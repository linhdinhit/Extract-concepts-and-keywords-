 Off the Beaten Track  This small town, on the southwest coast of Crete, was discovered by hippies in the 1960s. From then on its days as a quiet fishing village were numbered, but it remains a relaxing place favoured by backpackers. On summer evenings, the main street is closed and the tavernas (traditional restaurants) move onto the road. Reachable by boat from Paleohora is tiny Elafonisi, which has one of the loveliest sand beaches in Crete. In summer there are three buses a day from Hania; in winter there are two. Summer also sees daily ferries between Paleohora and Hora Sfakion.
