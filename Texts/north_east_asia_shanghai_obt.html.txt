 Off the Beaten Track  There are three main perspectives on Shanghai - from the gutters, from the heights (ie from the battlements of the tourist fortresses) and from the waters. The Huangpu River offers some remarkable views of the Bund and the riverfront activity at night as well as during the day. Tour boats leave for 1, 2 and 3.5-hour tours from the dock on the Bund.
