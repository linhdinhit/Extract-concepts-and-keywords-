 Off the Beaten Track  This monument is home to about 15,000 prehistoric rock etchings, most created around 1300 AD by Indians who hunted in the area. Four trails of varying degrees of difficulty access the petroglyphs; the most challenging - Mesa Point Trail - climbs to the top of a lava flow and has good views of the petroglyphs, the surroundings and the encroaching housing developments. The national monument is 9mi (14km) northwest of downtown Albuquerque and is best accessed by car.
