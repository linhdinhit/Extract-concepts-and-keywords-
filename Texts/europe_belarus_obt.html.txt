 Off the Beaten Track  Njasvizh, 120km (75mi) south-west of Minsk, is one of the oldest towns in the country. It dates from the 13th century, but reached its zenith in the mid-16th century when its ruling merchants had it rebuilt with an advanced system of fortifications. Over the centuries, war, fire and neglect diminished the town's status, and today it's a random mix of painted wooden cottages and bland housing scattered with fine 16th century architecture.  The 16th century town hall is one of the oldest in the country - it's shabby and faded but has an interesting design. The Slutsk Gate, also built in the 16th century, was redone in Baroque style 2 centuries later. The large and sombre Farny Polish Roman Catholic Church is early Baroque style and features a splendidly proportioned facade. Beyond the church, the Radziwill Palace Fortress was designed by the Italian architect Bernardoni in the 16th century and today houses a sanitarium for cardiac and neurological patients.
