 Attractions  In ancient times Lahaina was the Maui chiefs' royal court, and the bread(fruit) basket of West Maui. Kamehameha I used Lahaina as his base, and for a time it was the capital of the newly unified Hawaiian islands. The whaling years reached their peak in the 1840s, when hundreds of whalers pulled into port to visit the town's dance halls, bars and brothels. These days the streets are jammed with tourists, and the old wooden shops that once housed saloons and provision stores are now crammed with boutiques and galleries. If you're expecting something quaint and romantic, you'll be disappointed: Lahaina is abuzz with commercial activity. But the scenery is pretty, there are soft breezes off the water and you'll get fine sunset views of Lanai.  Lahaina's top sightseeing spots are its 19th-century historical sites. The Old Courthouse, built in 1859, is now home to a gallery exhibiting work by Lahaina artists. The Baldwin House, the oldest building in Lahaina, was built in 1834. Wo Hing Temple, on Front St, was built in 1912 by Lahaina's Chinese community. It's now a museum of Chinese-Hawaiian artifacts. An attached theater shows films taken in Hawaii by Thomas Edison at the turn of the century. Hale Paahao Prison, built in 1852 by convicts, is now a museum dedicated to describing life in the slammer in the 19th century. At Hale Pai, where Hawaii's first printing press was built to churn out the Good Book for wayward heathens, you can see early books or print your own page on a replica press.
