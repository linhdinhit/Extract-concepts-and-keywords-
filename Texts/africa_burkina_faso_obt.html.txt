 Off the Beaten Track  Gorom-Gorom, in the northeast of Burkina Faso, is a typical Sahelian town, with its edges smudged into a sea of sand dunes and wide windswept spaces. This is where civilisation runs out of puff. From here on in it's all lonely desert dunes and whistling silences. The accommodation in Gorom-Gorom is traditional Sudanese style, so it's easy to immerse yourself in the ambience of Sahelian life. The largely nomadic population are mainly Tuaregs (or 'blue men of the desert'), Peuls, Maures, and Songha s.  The Gorom market is unquestionably the most colourful and interesting in Burkina Faso, if not the Sahel, and may well be the country's largest. The mixing and melding of the different Sahelian and Saharian ethnic groups make it a sight worth seeing. There's Tuareg herders in indigo robes; Peul herders and Songha farmers in bright yellow and red turbans; Peul women with brightly couloured boubous (robes), intricately braided, beaded, and bejewelled hairdos, and large silver and gold hooped earrings. The men wear richly decorated leather belts and elaborate silver swords. And that's without even beginning to describe the intriguing desert food and desert crafts for sale.  Gorom-Gorom is about 290km (180mi) north east of Ouagadougou and can be reached by bus or bushtaxi/minibus.
