 Activities  Alaska has enshrined its greater than great outdoors and there are more ways to partake than you can count on frostbitten fingers and toes. Some of the best hiking trails are the Chilkoot Trail near Skagway, which was used by gold prospectors late last century; the Resurrection Pass Trail on the Kenai Peninsula; and the Pinnell Mountain Trail near Hyder, which has great views of the midnight sun. Alaska has some great paddling opportunities at Misty Fiords National Monument, Glacier Bay National Park and Katmai National Park. Blue-water paddling - coastal touring in ocean kayaks - is very popular throughout Southeast and Southcentral Alaska, and is also good at Muir Inlet in Glacier Bay National Park or Tracy Arm Fjord, south of Juneau. Fishing in ubiquitous rivers, streams and lakes yields rainbow and cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden, Arctic char and grayling.
