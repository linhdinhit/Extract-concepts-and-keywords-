 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: only a valid passport is necessary for citizens of most countriesHealth risks:Amoebic Meningitis from bathing in natural hot thermal poolsTime: GMT/UTC +12(two hours ahead of Australian Eastern Standard Time)Electricity: 240V AC, 50 HzWeights & measures: metric When to Go  The weather is never so miserable that there's no point in going to New Zealand: there are things to see and do all year-round. The warmer months (November to April) are busiest, especially during the school holidays from December 20 to the end of January. Ski resort towns are obviously busier during the winter months. If you're travelling during peak periods (especially the Christmas season) it's best to book ahead, as much accommodation and transport fills up. It's probably more pleasant to visit either before or after this hectic period, when the weather is still warm and there aren't as many other travellers around.     Events  Some of the noteworthy cultural events include: Summer City Programme (January to February; Wellington) which is a series of festivals around the city; Marlborough Food & Wine Festival (2nd week in February; Blenheim); International Festival of the Arts (February, even-numbered years only; Wellington), an entire month of national and international culture; Golden Shears Sheep-Shearing Contest (March; Masterton), a must for lovers of sheep, scat and sweat; and Canterbury Show Week (November; Christchurch), which has agricultural exhibits, rides and local entertainment.
