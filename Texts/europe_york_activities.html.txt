 Activities  York offers a swag of specialised walking tours, whether your poison is ghosts, Romans, alleyways, scholarly history or Yorkshire bitter. For something less rigorous, take a river cruise on the Ouse, or shop for York Minster snow domes in the Shambles and antiquarian oddities in the bookshops of Micklegate and Fossgate.
