 Activities  The long, rugged islands off Croatia's mountainous coast make this a yachting paradise. There are plenty of deep channels, quaint ports and good steady winds. It's also a great area for sea kayaking, especially around the Elafiti Islands and the Kornati Islands. The varied topography of the coast has spurred a growing diving industry and nearly every coastal resort has a dive centre. The main attractions are shipwrecks and caves (including the famous Blue Grotto). There are excellent rock climbing opportunities, especially in Paklencia National Park and the rocks surrounding Baska on Krk Island. For landlubbers, Risnjak and Paklencia National Parks both have excellent areas for hiking.
