 Off the Beaten Track  Rab Island, near the centre of the Kvarner island group off north-western Croatia, is one of the most enticing in the Adriatic. The north-eastern side of the island is barren and rocky, while the south-western side is green with pine forests. Medieval Rab town, one of the prettiest in the region, is built on a narrow peninsula which encloses a sheltered harbour - stone buildings climb from the harbour to a cliff overlooking the sea. Rab has been ruled by both Venice and Austria, and these days you'll hear as much German as Croatian spoken.  The towers of four of Rab's churches are easy to spot among the town's mass of red-roofed houses. The Monastery of St Anthony was built in 1675, the Romanesque Cathedral of St Mary the Great (currently being restored) has a pleasant terrace which overlooks the sea, and the St Justine Church is now a small museum of religious art. All that remains of Rab's oldest church St John's is the bell tower and the foundations. Take a walk along the city wall for spectacular views of the town, or head north to the shady walkways of the Komrcar Park. Rab Island is accessible by ferry and bus; ferries depart for Rab from the mainland port of Jablanac.
