 Off the Beaten Track  One of Auckland regional parks, Ambury is a working farm right on the city's doorstep. The park is about 15km (9mi) south of Auckland city, near the airport, on the shores of the Manukau Harbour. There are sheep, cows, horses, goats, chickens, peacocks, turkeys and kune kune (a type of wild pig). Some 86 species of birds live on the foreshore, including pied stilts, welcome swallows, and oyster-catchers. It's also a favourite wintering ground for migrant birds. You can wander freely around the farm (remember to close the gates) and there's no entry charge.  A detour across Wallace Rd takes you to Mangere Mountain, a volcanic cone created some 18,000 years ago and the site of one of Auckland's largest pa (the remains of kumara pits can still be seen). You can also take a horseback tour through the park.
