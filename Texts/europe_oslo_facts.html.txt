 When to Go  Oslo's summers are warm compared to the rest of Scandinavia and even its winters don't have that hard edge that many expect. Days of 30 C (86 F) aren't frequent but neither are they uncommon in summer, although visitors are more likely to experience mild, sunny days of around 22 C (72 F) in July. The sun is never far from the horizon in mid-summer in Oslo while in the northern part of the country, it never sets at all. Consequently, winter means there's little sunlight. During the day, the city seems covered by eternal dusk. The one drawback about high summer is that Oslo is positively crowded with tourists and therefore prices, and demand for accommodation, rise. May is a good time to visit as the weather is getting warmer and the tourist season hasn't quite begun. If it's cold and it's snowsports you're after, then Oslo in winter is a majestic sight as a blanket of white covers the city. Temperatures won't really climb over 0 C (32 F) in mid-winter. Oslo's rainfall is spread throughout the year but March, April and May have the lowest averages.     Events  Oslo celebrates Norway's national holiday, Constitution Day (17 May), with gusto. People take to the streets in traditional dress and marching bands and thousands of schoolchildren parade down Karl Johans Gate to the Royal Palace and are greeted by the royal family. In March, there's the Holmenkollen ski festival and in August the Oslo International Jazz Festival draws a large following. The Ultima Contemporary Music Festival gets going in October.
