 Off the Beaten Track  No one really knows who built this town, 10 km from the Syrian border and about 20 km east of Mafraq. The strange black basalt settlement is in the south of the city of Hauran. It is thought to have been founded in the 2nd century AD, and at one stage was part of the defensive line of Rome's Arab outposts. It continued to flourish into Umayyad times, but the earthquakes which hit Jordan in 747 wiped out Umm Al-Jimal, and the city was never rebuilt.  Most of the remaining buildings were once the houses and shops of ordinary people. Among the few larger buildings still standing are a combined barracks/church building, and a ruin known as the Western Church. You can visit Umm Al-Jimal in a day trip from Amman.
