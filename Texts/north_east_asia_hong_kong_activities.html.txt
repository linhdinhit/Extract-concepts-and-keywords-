 Activities  There are plenty of bike paths in the New Territories, and it's easy to rent a bike, especially around Tolo Harbour. If you like fishing, there are plenty of people who'll take you out on a boat, or you can dip your rod in one of the city's reservoirs. You'll need to be cashed up to play on one of Hong Kong's five golf courses - if you're not, try hiking in Country Parks. Lantau Island and the MacLehose Trail in the New Territories are also good for a leg stretch. There are good beaches everywhere except Kowloon and the north side of Hong Kong Island - the best ones are on the Outlying Islands. Windsurfing and sailing are both extremely popular, and there are several yacht clubs and outlets where you can rent boards or small craft. Tennis and gym are also popular.
