 When to Go  Weather forecasts often don't mean much in Alaska, as unpredictability is the order of most days. That said, however, Anchorage air usually averages about 60 or 70 F from June to August. The city, which is shielded by the Kenai Mountains, has an annual rainfall of 14in (35cm) and annual snowfall of over 70in (178cm). The average temperature in January is 13 F, but can dip to 8 F or get as 'high' as 21 F. The Anchorage Bowl - the city and surrounding area - has its fair share of overcast days, especially in early and late summer. The longest day is summer solstice (June 21), when the sun sets for a mere four hours. In late June and July the nightshade is replaced by dusk.     Events  If, as you're casually strolling the city, your hat flies off as hundreds of dogsleds zoom past you, you'll know you're in time for March's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, in which participants tackle over 1000mi (1609km) of Alaskan wilderness between Anchorage and Nome. In June, brandish that sword in celebration of the days of yore at the Alaska Renaissance Festival. One of the biggest celebrations in Anchorage, and statewide, occurs June 21, the longest day of the year; the place to be is the Moose Pass Summer Solstice Festival, where the BBQ chicken alone is worth the trip. A couple weeks later, Independence Day (July 4) always sparks up with plenty of events. In August, the annual Alaska State Fair in Palmer, just north of Anchorage, is the one-stop shop for rodeos, entertainers and pumpkins the size of igloos.
