 Activities  Berlin's many parks and forests are tailormade for walking and jogging. There are also dozens of swimming pools to choose from. Soccer, volleyball, handball and other team sports are popular too, but you usually have to join a club. In the outer suburbs you'll find large sports centres that combine, all under one roof, a pool, squash and tennis courts, fitness studios, sauna etc. One of the more central is the Sport-und Erholungszentrum in the Friedrichshain district, which even incorporates an ice rink. The countryside around central Berlin has many lovely cycling routes. Ice skating is available at a number of indoor rinks from mid-Oct to early March.
