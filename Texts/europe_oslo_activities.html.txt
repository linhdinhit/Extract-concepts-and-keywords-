 Activities  If you crave the great outdoors and you're visiting Oslo in summer, then you're in luck. Oslo is very much a 'get out and do it' place. In summer, swimming is possible at the nearby beaches and hiking can be enjoyed by following a good selection of trails. Oslo's fresh air is good for cycling, climbing and horse riding - your lungs will thank you. Boat trips, folk dancing and fishing are also popular activities. Winter visitors don't miss out either. Aside from the awesome skiing opportunities, ice skating can be enjoyed, particularly when the Narvisen outdoor rinks freeze over naturally. Dog sledding and sleigh rides are a winter novelty for many visitors.
