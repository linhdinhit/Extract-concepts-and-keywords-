 Activities  Senegal's best beaches are found in the Casamance around Cap Skiring. Closer to Dakar, check out Pointe de Bel-Air and the beaches of N'Gor, Malika-sur-Mer and Yoff. You can rent a sailboard or go water-skiing at several of these beaches. The coast off the Pointe des Almadies offers some of the best scuba diving in West Africa. In particular, check out the waters around le de N'Gor, the Almadies area and le de Goree. The waters are at their best from February to April. If you find the salt water too 'natural' for your liking, nearly all the top-end hotels of Dakar have swimming pools.  Dakar's cool weather means that jogging is a realistic option - a rarity in Africa. Most of the major hotels have tennis and (less commonly) squash courts. Bird-watchers shake their tail feathers for the sights at the Parc National aux Oiseaux du Djoudj, the Parc National de la Langue de Barbarie and the Sine-Saloum Delta. Those hoping to spot something furrier will have better luck at the Parc National de Niokolo-Koba.
