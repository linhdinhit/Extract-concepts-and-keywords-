 Environment  The Balearics are made up of four major islands - Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera - surrounded by several small, rocky islets. Mallorca, the largest of the islands, is fringed with sparkling sandy beaches to the north and rocky coves and harbors along the south coast. The spectacular Serra de Tramuntana mountain range that makes up Mallorca's spine tops out at 1445m(4740ft)Puig Major.  Menorca was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1993, and it's well worth braving the sometimes chilling tramuntana winds to visit its largely untouristed beaches, coves and ravines. Ibiza and Formentara are hot and dry, the perfect climate for drinking beer on the beach.  Luxuriating in that perfect-for-human-habitation Mediterranean climate, the Balearics enjoy a mild winter and fairly hot summer, which forces even the most reticent visitor to spend quality time along the coast. Temperatures average around 15 C (60 F) in the winter and 27 C (85 F) in the summer, keeping the temperature just about perfect for outdoor activities.
