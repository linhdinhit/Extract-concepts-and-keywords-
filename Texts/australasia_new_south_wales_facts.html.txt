 Facts for the Traveler   Facts for the TravelerTime: Eastern Standard Time (UTC plus 10 hours)Electricity: 220-240VWeights & measures: metric When to Go  Balmy summers and mild winters in northern NSW make this region a good place to visit year-round, though Sydney's summers might be too hot to handle if you don't like the odd 40 C (104 F) day. The winter months of June, July and August are the only time to visit the outback (it's unpleasantly hot in summer) or to try out your slaloming on the state's southern ski slopes.     Events  After riotous New Year's Eve celebrations that feature spectacular pyrotechnics displays in Sydney, the first big celebration of the year is Australia Day, commemorating the arrival of the First Fleet in Sydney Cove. Aboriginal people celebrate an alternative occasion, Survival Day, or Invasion Day, on the same day, with a festival of music, dance and arts.  In February, Tamworth's Country Music Festival sends a loud 'yee-ha' out of the state's west and has the whole city bootscooting, while Sydney's Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gra concludes with the glitzy glam of the parade down Oxford St. Surfest, held each March in Newcastle, is Australia's longest-running professional surf carnival, and Byron Bay gets down and dirty in April with the East Coast Blues and Roots Festival.  Motor-racing enthusiasts get their motors running at the Bathurst 1000 touring car race in October. After Christmas celebrations, the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race sets sail from the state capital and traces its way down the southern coast.
