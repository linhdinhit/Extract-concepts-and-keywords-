 Environment  Located on the northeast coast of South America, French Guiana is roughly the same size as Ireland or the US state of Indiana. It borders Brazil in the east and south, the Atlantic in the north and Suriname to the west, where the Maroni (Marowijne) and Litani rivers encompass a disputed border area.  Approximately 90% of the country is blanketed by scarcely populated equatorial forest, which rises gradually from the coastal strip toward the modest Tumac-Humac Mountains on the Brazilian frontier. Most Guianais live along the Atlantic coast, and the area contains most of the country's limited road network. The coast comprises mainly mangrove swamp with a few sandy beaches. Fauna includes monkeys, caimans, tapirs, ocelots and anteaters.  French Guiana is a wet country: even when it's not raining, the air hangs heavy with humidity. The country's tropical rainforests top out at around 30 C (85 F) and receive over 250cm (100in) of rain per annum. The rain falls heaviest from January to June, with May seeing the worst of it. Cayenne, the capital, and Guiana's other Atlantic coast settlements are less muggy than inland areas, but that's not saying much.
