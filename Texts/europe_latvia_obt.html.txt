 Off the Beaten Track  The origins of the Crocodile Dundee story can be traced to this little village set among three lakes. The centrepiece of the village is a huge statue of a crocodile, given to Dundaga by the Latvian Consulate in Chicago in 1995. The statue honours Arvids von Blumenfelds, a local who fled to Australia during WWII and spent his days hunting crocodiles in the Outback. The film is said to be based on the exploits of this Dundaga hero.  Dundaga's castle is also steeped in legend, since a fair maiden who made the tragic mistake of intruding upon a gnomes' wedding is said to have been walled up here alive. Locals say she still haunts the castle, only appearing during a full moon. Dundaga lies north-east of Riga, 20km (12mi) inland from the Gulf of Riga coast, and is best reached by car.
