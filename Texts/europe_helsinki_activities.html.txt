 Activities  Helsinkiites love the outdoors, and the city provides ample parks, gardens and squares to accommodate active citizens. Rollerblading is very popular, as is bicycling. The bike and skate route map is free at the city tourist office, and there are many rental options. Golfers are also well catered for, with many golf courses around Helsinki.  Helsinki has several public swimming pools with inexpensive admission. The most impressive is the Itäkeskus swimming hall. The entire underground swimming hall - with several pools, saunas and a gym - is carved from rock and can also double as a bomb shelter for 3800 people. Saunas are a national obsession - find out why at one of the public facilities (unless you're lucky enough to be invited to a home sauna).   Boating is an enjoyable way to spend a day. Cruise on a historic steamship, or take a shorter sea cruise from the fish market. The trip around the island of Laajasalo is probably the most interesting.  The city's parks and surrounding forests have excellent hiking trails, which become skiing trails in winter. For a less strenuous walk, take a stroll along the lovely Esplanadi or around the market square, where you can browse for fresh fish, berries and arts and crafts.
