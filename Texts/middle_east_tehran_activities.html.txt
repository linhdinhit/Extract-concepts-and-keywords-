 Activities  While Tehran offers fine opportunities for lovers of dodging unpredictable traffic, you'll have to go beyond the city for any other activity. Trekking is possible in the Alborz Mountains at Darband, Darakeh and Tochal, while from Karaj, it is possible to trek to the Caspian Sea. Mountaineering, rock climbing and even skiing is also possible to the north of Tehran.
