 Environment  Eritrea sits above the Horn of Africa on the vast continent's east coast, squeezed in-between the large mass of Sudan to the north, and long-time rival Ethiopia and the geopolitical sliver of Djibouti to the south. It has a total land area of 124,320 sq km (48,500 sq mi) which is divided into three main geographical zones: the western lowlands; the fertile and intensively farmed central highland region; and the eastern escarpment and coastal plains, which are mainly desert and include one of the most inhospitable regions on earth, Danakalia. Over 350 tiny islands pepper the waters of the Red Sea to the east, over half of which make up the Dahlak Archipelago.  The east of the country is covered mainly by semidesert vegetation, brushland and thicket - which also predominate in the west - with some mangrove swamps thrown in for good measure. In the highlands, you'll be tiptoeing through juniper and wild olives, while to the northeast of the capital Asmara is the last batch of tropical woodland in the country. The animals most commonly encountered in Eritrea include wild cats, Abyssinian hares, jackals, warthogs and gazelles, plus over 500 species of birds; rarer sightings involve elephants and lions (in the west), oryxes and crocodiles. Life in the Red Sea includes significant coral reefs, dugongs and turtles. Unfortunately, due to the war and the consequent destruction of habitats, just about every animal in the country is now considered 'endangered'.  Climate-wise, the country's highlands are the most accommodating, with average annual temperatures around 18 C (64.5 F) and spirit-dampening heavy rainfalls occurring only in July and August. Average temperatures in the west range from 30-41 C (86-106 F). The low, eastern portion of Eritrea has staked its claim as nature's frying pan - in the Danakil Depression, the heat can reach 50 C (122 F) and rain is an extinct species.
