 Activities  Spectator sports come into their own in sports-mad Liverpool, and football is the obvious pastime of choice. Liverpool FC's ground is at Anfield, 3mi (5km) from Lime St, and if the game's full there's a museum and tour to compensate. Everton's home ground is 2mi (3km) from town at Goodison Park, and it too has tours. Tickets to games at either ground are hard to come by - turn up on the day and hope for the best! Liverpool's pub and club scene is still going strong, and for many the city's party-till-dawn nightlife is an activity in its own right. Of course, no trip to Liverpool is complete without taking a ferry ride across the you-know-what, or a Magical Mystery Strawberry Fields Penny Lane Beatles bus tour.
