 Attractions  Once a sleepy colonial capital, Yaounde is now a bustling urban centre of meandering streets and undulating hills, offering an unusually cool climate, excellent museums and really good grilled chicken. Ave Kennedy is the main commercial corridor. At its northern end are the Place Kennedy and the Centre Artisinal, a giant tent filled with local artisans and their handicrafts. The lively African quarters of Messa, Mokolo and Briqueterie, a few kilometres north-west of downtown, are where you'll find many of the city's unlicensed chicken houses, serving the best grilled chicken this side of the C te d'Ivoire.  A few kilometres north of the city centre is the Benedictine Monastery's Musee d'Art Cameroonais, a highlight of any visit to the capital. Despite its small size, it's got one of the best collections of Cameroonian art in the world, including masks, bowls and Bamoun bronze pipes. Even the monastery's chapel is decorated with a beautiful array of local textiles and crafts. The monastery is near the foot of Mt Febe and is accessible by bus or taxi from downtown.  A few kilometres west of downtown is the Quartier Melen, home to the Musee d'Art Negre. The museum's collection includes Bamoun pipes from north-west Cameroon, Baoule textiles from C te d'Ivoire and Congolese-Za rian masks, as well as pieces from Algeria and Ethiopia. Melen is also home to the Paroisse de N'Djong Melen, a church whose open-air Sunday mass you shouldn't miss. For over two hours, a priest recites the mass in Ewondo to the accompaniment of African drumming, dancing and singing.  Yaounde is in the south-western corner of the country, about 200km (124mi) from both the Atlantic Ocean and the southern border.
