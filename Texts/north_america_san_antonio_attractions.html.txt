 Attractions  The story of the Battle of the Alamo is one of America's most enduring legends. It was in here on 23 February, 1836, that John Wayne... sorry, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie and nearly 200 courageous Texan revolutionaries held out against an army of thousands of Mexican troops, defending the fort in a pivotal battle of the Texas War for Independence. A onetime Spanish presidio (fort), the Alamo is currently a shrine to those who died protecting it, run by the rather persnickety Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT), a group of women who trace their lineage directly to the period of the Texas Republic.  The surprising things about the Alamo today are its size - it's much smaller than you'd think - and its beauty. An ornately decorated portal leads to a typical Spanish Colonial church, constructed while the influence of the Muslims was still dominating much of Spanish church architecture. In the main chapel building is the Shrine, with an exhibit of the battle. Frequent free talks given by docents provide a history of the battle and of prerevolutionary life in San Antonio.  The Alamo occupies the entire area between Houston, Bonham and Crockett Sts and Alamo Plaza, a few minutes' walk northeast of downtown.
