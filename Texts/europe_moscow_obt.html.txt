 Off the Beaten Track  The Sandunovskiye Baths, in the narrow winding streets of the city's north, is Moscow's most famous bathhouse. These fading but grand 19th-century baths are a mixture of sauna and social club, with the sexes strictly segregated. For hours you can move between steam rooms and pools, interspersed with massages and birch-twig whippings. Traditionally men have a few beers with their mates while they steam themselves silly.
