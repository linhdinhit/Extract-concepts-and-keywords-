 Activities  There's a whole range of adventure activities to be had in Christchurch, or just on its fringe. Ballooning, fishing, horse trekking, jet boating, tandem skydiving, biplane flights and golf are all possible; ask at the visitor centre. There's very good rafting on the Rangitata River in Peel Forest and you can ski within a one to two-hour drive of Christchurch during the winter months.  For summer swimming or wind swept winter walks, the closest beaches to the city are Waimairi, North, New Brighton and South Brighton, east and northeast of the city and all accessible by bus. Sumner to the southeast is a favourite and also a great place to combine paddling, people watching and a bite to eat. Taylors Mistake, beyond Sumner, is a popular spot for  surfing.   Wine tours of the Waipara Valley and the surrounding Pegasus Bay area are a less active option, or there's Kaikoura to the north, famous as a wildlife enthusiast's Mecca. Not only is there whale watching, there's dolphin and seal swimming and even shark diving.
