 Off the Beaten Track  About 220km (136mi) north of Asmara is what appears at first glance to be just a remote, high-altitude collection of iron shacks, but Nakfa is a lot more than that. During much of Eritrea's long fight for independence, Nakfa served as the headquarters of the country's resistance movement and so became one of the more popular spots for touring Ethiopian bombs and bullets. The town has since been rewarded by becoming, in the eyes of Eritreans, a symbol of their hard-fought-for independence - not to mention by having the country's currency named after it. A visit to Nakfa, which entails a fairly arduous road trip, will give you a better understanding of what took place on the country's battlefields and will also take you to the heart of the collective Eritrean self-determination.  During wartime, the Eritrean soldiers literally lay low by building underground towns where they could make weapons, print pro-independence literature and tend to their wounded without exposing themselves to the eyes of the Ethiopian military, and many of these underground facilities are still accessible. Near Nakfa are the twin peaks of Den Den, a mountain that served as the rebels' radio transmission 'tower' during the war and which provides clear views of the surrounding area and all its battle scars. The last building left standing in town during the worst of the Ethiopian bombardments was the Nakfa Mosque, still standing now and still wearing the hole that was blown in its cupola.
