 Attractions  Don't be put off by the high-rise hotels and apartment blocks that mark the Costa del Sol: M laga is a vibrant, Spanish city with a real southern port atmosphere. It's the second largest city in Andaluc a and first stop in the region for many. With pretty old streets, leafy boulevards and lush gardens the city is a lovely place to explore.  A walk along the main boulevard, Alameda Principal, will take in the elegant 18th-century Palacio de la Aduana (Customs House), the early 20th-century Antiguo Correos (Old Post Office) and the stunning 20th-century neo-baroque City Hall. For earlier history check out the baroque/Gothic/Renaissance cathedral, built on the site of the former main mosque. It's called La Manquita (the One-Armed), as the southern tower was never completed. Alcazaba was the palace-fortress of M laga's Muslim governors. With two rings of walls, numerous defensive towers and staggered entrances, it's an impressive sight. You can wander around the parts that have been restored.  Picasso was born in M laga, and the brand spanking new Museo Picasso (Picasso Museum) is due to open in 2002. Until then, visitors can check out the Casa Natal de Picasso, a research centre that holds temporary exhibitions.
