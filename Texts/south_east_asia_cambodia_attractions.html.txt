 Attractions  The capital still retains an undeniable charm despite its tumultuous and often violent past. The crumbling colonial architecture makes an attractive backdrop to bustling streetside cafes and the redeveloped riverfront precinct - a particularly lively part of town on Friday and Saturday nights. The city has several impressive wats (temple-monasteries), including Wat Ounalom (headquarters of the Cambodian Buddhist patriarchate), Wat Phnom (the hilltop pagoda which gave the city its name) and the newly painted Wat Lang Ka. Pride of place goes to the spectacular Silver Pagoda, one of the few places in Cambodia where artefacts embodying the brilliance and richness of Khmer culture were preserved by the Khmer Rouge (although only 40% of its former glories were 'preserved'). The National Museum is another highlight, with outstanding displays of Khmer crafts.  The Killing Fields of Choeung Ek are a grisly reminder of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge. Some 17,000 people were killed here, just 15km south-west of the city centre, and more than 8000 skulls, arranged by sex and age, are visible behind the glass panel of the Memorial Stupa, which was erected in 1988. Prior to their murder, the victims had been detained at the prison known as S-21, housed in the Tuol Svay Prey High School. Today, the Tuol Sleng Museum serves as testament to the crimes of the Khmer Rouge, and few details of each victim's torture and death are left to the imagination.  The Central Market area, which includes Monirong Blvd, is the main centre for budget travellers, with cheap accommodation and plenty of food stalls. Head to the city's half-dozen or so street markets to browse and bargain for jewellery, antiques or the ubiquitous kramas (checked cotton scarves). The riverfront is the place to go for cheap beer and good food.
