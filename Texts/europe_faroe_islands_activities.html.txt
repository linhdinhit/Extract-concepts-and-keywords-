 Activities  There are great places for hiking and trekking in the Faroes. Before the road system existed, a series of cairns marked the way across country for walkers, and many of the cairns survive throughout the islands today. As well as taking warm and waterproof clothing, trekkers should carry a compass and, if possible, topographic maps of the area. Fishing is less restricted than in Iceland, and if you're trekking and camping in the highlands it may be a good idea to bring fishing tackle to help supplement your diet. Although it's not a diver's mecca, you can go diving, and shipwreck exploring and spearfishing are possible with a qualified instructor.
