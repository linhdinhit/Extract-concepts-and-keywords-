 Attractions  The Museum of New Mexico runs four museums in Santa Fe. The Palace of the Governors displays historical objects reflecting Santa Fe's Indian, Spanish, Mexican and American heritage. The 'palace' is one of the oldest public buildings in the country. Built in 1610 by Spanish officials, it housed thousands of villages when the Indians revolted in 1680 and was home to the territorial governors after 1846. Since 1909 the building has been a museum.  The Museum of International Folk Art is arguably the best museum in town. It houses more than 100,000 objects from more than 100 countries and the exhibits are so lively and evocative that a festive feel permeates the rooms. The Hispanic Wing displays religious art, tin work, jewelry and textiles from northern New Mexico and throughout the Spanish Colonial Empire, dating from the 17th century.   The Museum of Fine Arts is New Mexico's oldest art museum. The permanent collection is dominated by regional artists, while touring exhibitions have wider scope. The 1918 building is an excellent example of the original Santa Fe-style adobe.  The Museum of Indian Arts and Culture was opened in 1987 to display artifacts that have been unearthed by the Laboratory of Anthropology, which must confirm that any proposed building site in New Mexico is not historically significant. Since 1931 it has collected over 50,000 artifacts. Rotating exhibits explore the historical and contemporary lives of the Pueblo, Navajo and Apache cultures.
