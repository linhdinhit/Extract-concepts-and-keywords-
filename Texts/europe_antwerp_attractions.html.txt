 Attractions  This lopsided market 'square' (more of a truncated triangle), reserved for pedestrians and bordered by some marvellous Renaissance-style buildings, is not only the social heart of the old city centre but of Antwerp itself. Two sides of the square are dominated by the facades of some towering guildhalls, most of them constructed in the 19th century. These buildings were the headquarters of medieval Belgium's guilds, organisations that ostensibly represented groups of craftsmen (cloth-makers, tanners and so on) in matters of trade, but which coincidentally also helped increase the economic and political influence of wealthy, monopolising families.  The most expansive bit of Renaissance architecture on Grote Markt is the Stadhuis, or city hall, a building taking up almost the entire western side of the square. Built in 1565, the structure decided a Gothic look didn't suit it and opted for a mixed Flemish-and-Italian appearance that includes a statue-topped roofline. Near the Stadhuis' entryway is sculptor Constantin Meunier's Bag Bearer statue, a 19th-century bronze tribute to Antwerp's dock workers, while next door is the Etnografisch Museum (Ethnographic Museum), a roomy collection of worldly artefacts that includes tribal statues on long-term loan from the Congo (an enormous chunk of central Africa that was a Belgian colony until 1960) and tribal poles from the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya.  The centrepiece of the old marketplace is the unflinchingly baroque Brabo Fountain, a large above-ground pond containing an 1887 sculpture that relates the legend (as opposed to the likely facts) of the naming of Antwerp. This legend has it that a river-dwelling giant who demanded a toll from passing shipmasters (or, alternatively, one of their hands if they refused) was slain by a Roman warrior called Silvius Brabo, who capped off a good day at the office by slicing off the giant's hand and throwing it in the Scheldt - hand werpen (hand throwing) apparently became the Flemish moniker Antwerpen.
