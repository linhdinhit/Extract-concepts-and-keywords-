 Off the Beaten Track  Lovers of orchestrated history can step into the industrial past by travelling 10mi (16km) south of Manchester to Wilmslow's 18th-century cotton mill, nestled in the bucolic Styal Country Estate. Quarry Bank is a virtually intact example of an early factory complex, featuring steam engines and a fully functional iron waterwheel. Cloth is still produced at the mill, giving visitors a first-hand look at how the generated power is harnessed to drive the cotton mill machinery. Costumed guides at the nearby Apprentice House shed light on the depressing lives of the mill's young workers, orphaned youngsters who were shipped in from the nation's workhouses. The mill is surrounded by the fields, houses and chapels of Styal village, and there's plenty to muse upon while taking a walk around the evocative site. A free bus heads out to Styal from Manchester airport, or you can catch a train and walk for half a mile to the mill.
