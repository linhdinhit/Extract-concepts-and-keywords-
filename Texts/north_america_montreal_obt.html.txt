 Off the Beaten Track  Built for the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, the massive Parc Olympique cost Montrealers more than $US1 billion and is shrouded in the type of scandal, indignation and allegations of corruption that today's Olympic movement would be proud of. The irony is that the complex, 3km (2mi) east of downtown, is undeniably magnificent and an incredibly popular drawcard for the city. Finally completed in 1990, its grandiose mulitpurpose showpiece, the Stade Olympique (or 'Big O' to its friends), has carried on the controversial tradition, including a collapsed beam during a football game a year after completion, mechanical mishaps and a laughable litany of repairs. However, these have not dampened visitors' enthusiasm for its tours. A cable car runs up the Montreal Tower, which impressively overhangs the stadium, to a glassed-in observation deck, showing off stunning views of the city and beyond for a distance up to 80km (50mi).  Housed within the former velodrome at the Olympic Complex is the spectacular Biod me, which re-creates four distinct ecosystems and is home to 5000 plants and 4000 animals, including the too-cute penguins, monkeys and alligators. Elsewhere within Olympic Park are the Jardin Botanique, the third-largest Botanical Gardens in the world; with over 30 different garden settings and plant species galore; and the Insectarium, a great collection of creepy-crawlies that will endlessly fascinate even as they repulse.
