 Environment  Shaped like a cricket bat, St Kitts measures 23 miles (37km) by 7 miles (11km) wide, and is dominated by Mt Liamuiga, a lofty but dormant volcano. A few miles south of St Kitts is the green, roundish Nevis, which weighs in at only half the size of its neighbor. At the center of Nevis is another tall, dormant volcano, Nevis Peak, which got its name from a deluded Christopher Columbus, who thought its cloud-cloaked summit looked like snow ( neive is Spanish for snow).
