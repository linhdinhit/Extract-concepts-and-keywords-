 Off the Beaten Track  Iguela is a good place for a spot of fishing and is home to a fine wildlife reserve where forest elephants, buffalos, warthogs, crocodiles, monkeys, lowland gorillas and many species of birds hang out. The best time to go is between April and October when the weather is drier and travelling around the reserve is easier. The reserve is 300km (185mi) south of Libreville. There are flights between Libreville and Omboue, a few kilometres north of Iguela. During dry spells you can sometimes get to Omboue and Iguela from the Lambarene-Louila road.
