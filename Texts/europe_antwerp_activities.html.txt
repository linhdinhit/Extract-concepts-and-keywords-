 Activities  As far as physical exercise in Antwerp goes, you just can't beat walking. Go for a long exploratory totter across the cobblestones of the city's main people-only thoroughfares, keeping an eye out for the shoe-soiling aftermath of four-legged pedestrians. Antwerp also has a number of good cycling paths, many of them paved red and only infrequently blockaded by skyline-absorbed tourists. From mid to late-December (admittedly a very small window of opportunity), an open-air ice-skating rink sets itself up in the Grote Markt.  Shopaholics will love Antwerp for the up-to-the-second designer wear available from local and international talents in the fashion quarter, the district just south of the centre, which is loosely bound by Nationalestraat, Lombaardvest, Huidevettersstraat and Schuttershofstraat. Other local must-buys include antiques from the snooty emporiums lining the streets to the immediate southeast of the fashion quarter (for example, Leopoldstraat and Komedieplaats), something to rot the teeth with from one of the city's outstanding chocolatiers, and a wristful of diamonds and gold jewellery from the traders in Antwerp's diamond quarter, located south of Centraal Station mainly along Pelikaanstraat and Hoveniersstraat.
