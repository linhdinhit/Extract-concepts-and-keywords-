 Activities  Santiago has its fair share of outdoor activities. Although downtown's heavy traffic makes for unpleasant cycling, you can put the foot to the pedal in the suburbs and surrounding areas like the Caj n del Maipo. Public pools in Santiago tend to be pricey, but if you need to take a cooling dip try swimming at Parque O'Higgins. You can ace the love game at the International Sporting Club and Club de Tenis Estadio Nacional tennis courts. You can also be a spectator and watch soccer at the Estadio Nacional in u oa or horse racing at the Club H pico de Santiago. If you like your outdoor activities a bit more rugged, various organizations can help you climb and hike. One of Santiago's more uncommon entertainments is the Rodelbahn, a toboggan on wheels in the heights of the eastern suburb of La Reina. If all this exertion isn't your cup of tea, throw back some of the Chilean corked stuff in wine classes or widen your vocabulary with some Spanish language courses.
