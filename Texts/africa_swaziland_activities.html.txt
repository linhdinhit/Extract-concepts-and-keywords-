 Activities  If time is on your side, the best way to see Swaziland is by trekking, and several of the national parks offer excellent trails that are often generations old. Horse riding is another way to explore inaccessible parts of the country, and at Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary, not far from Mbabane, you can watch wildlife doing its thing from the back of a horse. White-water rafting, mountainbike riding and abseiling are growing in the popularity stakes.
