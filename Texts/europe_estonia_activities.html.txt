 Activities  Estonia's famous bogs offer such exotic activities as bog walking and canoeing. Popular bogging spots include the Soomaa National Park in the south-western corner of the country and the Endla Nature Reserve in the north. The K‰smu Sea Museum in Lahemaa National Park (on the central northern coast) arranges sailing, rowing and diving summer camps, as well as traditional one-log canoe-building camps where you can fashion your own haabja. You can also explore the bogs of Soomaa National Park via canoe and haabja.   Bird-watchers flock to Estonia and one of their principle targets is the Matsalu Nature Reserve, which arranges guided day hikes. Another major birding area is the K‰ina Bay Bird Reserve on the south-eastern coast of the island of Hiiumaa, where over 70 species breed.  Estonia offers excellent winter sports. You can ski and snowboard at the Kuutsem‰e and V‰ike-Munam‰e Sports Centres, both near Otep‰‰ in south-eastern Estonia. Also in the south-east, motorised snow-bike expeditions are available from V ru.
