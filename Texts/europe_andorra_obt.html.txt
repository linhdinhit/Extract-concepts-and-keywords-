 Off the Beaten Track  The hamlet of Llorts (pop 100) is set amidst fields of tobacco and backed by near-pristine mountains. It's one of the most untouched places in the whole country and is great for hiking. There's a popular 3.5 hour walk up the valley west of town along the de l'Angonella river, which leads to the Estanys de l'Angonella, a group of lakes. From slightly north of the village of El Serrat, about 3km (2mi) up the valley from Llorts, a secondary road leads to the Borda de Sorteny mountain shelter at 1970m (6460ft). From there, a trail continues on to a lake, Estany de l'Estany, and a 2915m (9560ft) mountain known as Pic de l'Estany. The Esglesia de Sant Mart, a tiny Romanesque church in La Cortinada, 2km (1mi) south of Llorts, has 12th century frescoes in remarkably good condition. Buses from Andorra la Vella make the 16km (10mi) run to Llorts and El Serrat daily; others make the 6km (4mi) trip from Ordino.
