 Environment  Although Glasgow lacks the instantly inspiring beauty of Edinburgh, it's one of Britain's largest, liveliest and most interesting cities, with a legacy of appealing Victorian architecture and several distinguished suburbs of terraced squares and crescents.  There are numerous green spaces within the city. Pollok Country Park surrounds the Burrell Collection with numerous woodland trails. Nearer the centre of the city, the Kelvin Walkway follows the River Kelvin through Kelvingrove Park, the Botanic Gardens and on to Dawsholm Park.  The city is surrounded by a grim hinterland of post-industrial communities. Industrial archaeologists could have a field day here, and some might see a perverse beauty in the endless suburbs of grey council house architecture. But it's here, possibly, that the Glasgow area's gritty black sense of humour is endangered.
