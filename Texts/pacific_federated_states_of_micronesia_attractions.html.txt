 Attractions  Kosrae is one of the least spoiled and least developed areas in the Federated States, a laid-back place that retains an air of innocence. The main island measures 42 sq miles (109 sq km) and is volcanic with an interior of uncharted rainforests, a pristine fringing reef and a coast which is a mix of sandy beaches and mangrove swamps. The people are casual and unpretentious and, given that it's unusual to have more than about a dozen visitors at a time on the island, the residents still take a friendly interest when someone new is in town.  Impressive ruins on the connected island of Lelu date from around the 14th century when Kosrae's chief's were the dominant regional power. Though the outskirts of the massive royal city have been torn down, the remaining ruins still give the feeling of being in an ancient, hidden city, the kind of isolated setting you might imagine trekking hours through dense jungle to find. Lelu Hill, the island's high point, has a scattering of caves and tunnels used by the Japanese in WWII.  Kosrae has unspoiled coral reefs close to shore that are suitable for both walk-in and boat diving. Underwater visibility can easily be 100ft (30m), and in summer as much as 200ft (60m). The Blue Hole in Lelu harbours coral heads, lionfish, stingrays and barracuda. In the south, a nice spot is Hiroshi's Point, a drift dive that takes in beautiful soft corals and hammerhead sharks. There's an American search plane in about 60ft (20m) of water at the mouth of Lelu Harbor. Also in the vicinity are two Japanese boats and the remains of a whaling ship.  Accommodation in Kosrae is limited to a scattered handful of small and not particularly cheap hotels. Camping is a fairly foreign concept, but amenable locals will probably help you arrange somewhere to pitch a tent. Flights between Guam and Honolulu generally make a free stopover in Kosrae and there are also island-hopping flights to Pohnpei and the neighbouring Marshall Islands' Majuro Atoll.
