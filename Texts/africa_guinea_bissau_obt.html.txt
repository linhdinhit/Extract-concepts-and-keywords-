 Off the Beaten Track   The 18-plus islands off the coast of Guinea-Bissau make up the Bijagos Archipelago, a Biosphere Reserve. Apart from Bubaque and Bolama, the islands are rarely visited by tourists and many of the Bijag -speaking islanders have never ventured from their homes. These more remote islands offer an opportunity to see unspoilt wilderness and beaches, as well as fascinating indigenous culture and traditions.  The islands to the northwest have stunning beaches and clear water; there's an airstrip on Caravela, so if you're feeling flash you can charter a plane. The southern Orango group of islands are a national park harbouring saltwater hippos, crocodiles and birds in palm groves and woodland. It's also one of the largest nesting sites for the green and Ridley turtle on the West African coast.  With the exception of Bubaque and Bolama, the islands are quite hard to get to; ferry connections are inconvenient and tourist facilities virtually nonexistent. But if you have time and perseverance, you can't get much farther off the beaten track.
