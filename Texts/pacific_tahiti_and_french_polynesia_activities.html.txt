 Activities  French Polynesia has some beautiful beaches, lagoons and open ocean, and it's the water-based activities most visitors come for. The region is a mecca for divers who come to see the rich and abundant marine life in warm pristine waters and for some unusual diving environments. The passes and lagoon of Rangiroa in the Tuamotus are a justly famous diving location. Those who prefer to float can strap on a snorkel and mask and experience the vibrant and giddy underworld without leaving the water's surface.  Tahiti is the birth place of surfing and there are popular breaks at Papenoo, Punaauia, and Paea. Other islands, particularly Huahine and Moorea, offer surfers clean consistent swell in warm uncrowded waters. The October-to-March period brings swells from the north and between April and September southerly winds bring heavy swells up from the Antarctic region.   Walkers and climbers will enjoy the high islands throughout the region and 4WD enthusiasts can hire vehicles in Papeete and other larger towns. Equestrian types can massage saddle-sores after a day's ride across the mountains and plateaus of many of the islands, and in the Marquesas horse riding is still the way a lot of local people get about. There are opportunities for hang-gliders and fans of parapente around the Tahitian island and Papeete has clubs and facilities for enthusiasts.
