 Environment  Both islands grew out of volcanoes, and they have central, volcanic highlands from which numerous fast flowing streams barrel down to the sea. They are slightly larger in area than New York City, and bask under the sun in the Bight of Biafra, just north of the equator. The rainforests were thick on both islands until the Portuguese arrived and established plantations of sugar and cocoa, but dense stands of native bush still survive. Over 80% of the population lives on the island of S o Tome, and more than 75% of that is still forested. The flora and fauna are similar to that on mainland Equatorial Guinea, although there are several endemic species. Both islands are subject to drought and soil erosion owing to loss of forest cover.  The climate is equatorial. The driest and coolest months are from June to September, when temperatures hover around 29 C (82 F). The wettest month is March, when the rain beats down monotonously and temperatures rise to around 30 C (86 F). Several microclimates exist, particularly on S o Tome island, where the north has a drier, savannah-like climate and the south receives much more rain, even during the dry season.
