 Attractions  Built to defend Cape Town, this stone-walled castle has not seen action in all its 350 years, unless you count the more recent stormings by hoards of school kids and tourists. It's worth coming for one of the tours, although you can quite easily find your own way around. Besides extensive displays of militaria, some interesting ones on the castle's archeology and the reconstruction of the so-called Dolphin Pool, the highlight is the bulk of the William Feur Collection, which includes some fabulous bits of Cape Dutch furniture, such as a table seating 100, and some more paintings by John Thomas Baines. Also within the Castle grounds are a noted wine shop, a cafe and a good restaurant.
