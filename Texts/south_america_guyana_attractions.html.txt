 Attractions  Guyana's capital and only large city lies on the east bank at the mouth of the Demerrara River. Georgetown had a miserable beginning, but developed into an attractive colonial city distinguished by gracious colonial architecture. Today, parts of the city, notably the central area and the botanic and zoological gardens are well-maintained, but the rest of the city is weathered and dilapidated. A profusion of flowering trees lend it the somewhat optimistic name 'Garden City of the Caribbean', despite its location on the Atlantic coast. A long sea wall protects the city from flooding; locals pass their time there swimming, sunbathing and strolling arm-in-arm.  Most of the sights are on or near Main St, including the Gothic-style St George's Cathedral, reputedly the world's tallest wooden cathedral, and the neoclassic Parliament Building, built in 1833. Much of the city center is dwarfed by the Stabroek Market, an imposing cast-iron building with a striking clocktower. Good value also are the idiosyncratic Museum of Guyana, which has exhibitions of excellent Guyanese paintings and sculpture, and the Botanical Gardens & Zoo, a beautifully laid out enclosure of Victorian bridges, pavilions, palms and lily ponds.  Budget accommodation, cheap food joints, jazz bars, clubs and discos are all close to Main St.
