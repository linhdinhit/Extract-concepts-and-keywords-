 Attractions  Monaco's royal palace has been around since the 13th century. Every Grimaldi since has found it necessary to leave their mark on the place, and as a result this is not one of Europe's most elegant castles. It is worth taking a look inside though - 15 rooms, including the Throne Room, are open to the public. If you've already blown your cash and can't afford the entrance fee, the changing of the guard won't cost you a cent. It starts at 11:55am precisely and is over within two minutes, so be on time.  In the south wing of the palace, the Musee des Souvenirs Napoleoniens has a collection of Napoleon's personal knickknacks, including one sock, a handkerchief and a bunch of medals, coins, uniforms and swords.
