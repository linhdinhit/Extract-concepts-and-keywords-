 Off the Beaten Track  Santo Ant o, just north of S o Vicente, is one of the most beautiful islands and well worth a visit. The greenest island in the archipelago, it's one of the few places where you'll see lots of trees. None of the towns on the island is particularly interesting, but what's special is the hilly and relatively lush interior; hikers will love it. There are flights between Santo Ant o and Mindelo (on S o Vicente) three times a week; you can connect at Mindelo with flights to Praia. There's also a ferry between the island and Mindelo; the trip takes about an hour each way, but even on this short stretch the seas can be pretty rough.
