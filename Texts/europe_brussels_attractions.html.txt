 Attractions  Grand Place is the heart of Brussels, a top tourist draw and a vibrant, beautiful and functional part of the city. The magnificent square boasts popular sidewalk cafes, intimate cellar restaurants, the country's finest guildhouses and the splendid H tel de Ville (Town Hall), a gothic masterpiece.  The square dates from the 12th century and was once marshland. By the mid-14th century, Brussels was booming and a prosperous market covered not only the Grand Place but also the surrounding streets, as evidenced by names such as rue au Beurre (Butter St), rue des Bouchers (Butchers' St) and rue du Marche aux Poulets (Chicken Market St).  The city's increasingly wealthy merchant guilds established headquarters - guildhouses - right in the middle of the milieu. The city added the H tel de Ville, cementing the Grand Place's role as the hub of commercial, political and civic life in Brussels. If you were promoting a jousting tournament or public execution in medieval Belgium, this would have been your A-list venue.  Most of the square's historic buildings were destroyed in 1695, when France's King Louis XIV bombed the area for 36 hours. The H tel de Ville was the only major building to survive - ironic, considering that it was the primary target - and nearly all the other buildings on Grand Place today are 17th-century replacements. The superb structure of Grand Place, with its creamy fa ade covered in stone reliefs and an intricate 100m-high (328ft-high) tower topped by a gilded statue of St Michel, is open for guided tours.  The Grand Place radiates different auras depending on the time of day and season. In the morning, superb guildhouses at the bottom (southern) end glint in the sun; at dusk, the azure sky becomes a vivid backdrop to the illuminated buildings. During the summer a carpet of flowers covers the whole square, and in winter ice-skaters swirl across the transformed cobbled surface.
