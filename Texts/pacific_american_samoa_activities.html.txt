 Activities  As with many Pacific islands, the greatest attractions for visitors to American Samoa are located in the water. A combination of spectacular coral reefs and undersea coral walls, some over 20m (66ft) deep, makes scuba diving, skin diving and snorkelling attractive options. Experience is necessary for any of these activities, as shallow coral, pounding surf and swift water movements makes most of the coastline treacherous.  Although currently limited, American Samoa is also a burgeoning region for hiking. The steep mountains and lack of established trails mean that only weather-beaten hikers need apply at the moment. The US National Parks Service is planning to establish tracks in the Tutuila and Ta'u sections of the huge National Park of American Samoa. One well-worn track offering great views of Pago Pago and the rugged northwest coast takes you on a 3mi (5km) climb up Mt Alava.
