 Environment  Smaller than Belgium, Armenia sits on an isthmus of land between the Black and the Caspian seas, landlocked between Iran to the south-east, Turkey along the south-western corner, Georgia up north and Azerbaijan on the eastern border. The land rises in the north to form the Little Caucasus mountain range, ( Maly Kavkaz), and arid flatlands creep southwards into Turkey and Iran. Only 10% of the country lies below 1000m (3280ft), and its highest point is the 4090m (13,415ft) Mt Aragats. The Araks River forms most of Armenia's border with Iran and part of the border with Turkey. You can travel from semi-desert foothills to alpine country within a few kilometres, and the fertile Ararat Valley produces most of the country's agricultural wealth.  Armenian wildlife includes the tur (wild goat), the mouflon (a wild sheep), the chamois (an antelope-like goat) and a fabulous array of wildflowers during spring and summer. The autumn colours in the forests around Lake Sevan are glorious. Unfortunately, over one third of the lake, the country's only fresh water reservoir, has been drained for hydropower, threatening water supplies. Azerbaijan's energy blockade has led to massive deforestation as citizens have scavenged and cut down trees for firewood. Forests and woodlands cover a little over a tenth of Armenia, arid land about 18%, and one-third is pasture.  The country is protected from the worst of Russia's harsh winters by the Northern Caucasus Mountains, and consequently much of its weather blows in from Persia and Syria. November to April/May is the wettest season, but Armenia does not get as much rain as some of its neighbours. The mountains in the south are usually covered with snow during winter, but lower areas like the Ararat Valley often remain warm, (and very hot in summer). The south is sub-tropical.
