 Activities  Grenada's most popular beaches for sunbaking and swimming are all in the southwest of the island. They include the fine sweep of white sand at Grand Anse, nearby Morne Rouge Bay and True Blue. Calvigny Island, off the island's southwestern coast, has a couple of pretty beaches; you can reach them by shuttle boat from Secret Harbour or by asking fisherpeople around Woburn Pier. If you want to have a beach to yourself, head to Carriacou.  The waters around Grenada have extensive reefs, with good coral, fish, turtles and other marine life. Dives come in a variety of flavors, including shallow reefs, walls, drifts and shipwrecks. The best sites are Bose Reef, Dragon Bay and Grand Mal Point. It's also worth checking out the unpopulated islands between Grenada and Carriacou. Kick 'em Jenny is worth visiting for the name alone, but the tiny island is also surrounded by pristine waters with great visibility; there's a sheer wall dive at Sisters Island. Moliniere Point, just north of St George's, has the island's best snorkeling, although land access is difficult. If you're interested in game fishing, blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish and yellowfin tuna swim in Grenada's waters. The best catches are in the winter months.  Good hiking trails wind through the Grand Etang rainforest, which occupies the center of Grenada. They include the Mt Qua Qua Trail, which leads to the top of a ridge with fine views of the forest; the Seven Sisters Falls Trail, which leads to a series of seven waterfalls; and the gentle but frequently muddy Grand Etang Shoreline Trail. There's also a network of short walking trails in the La Sagesse Nature Centre, on the island's southeastern coast. The trails explore the former estate of the late Lord Brownlow, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.
