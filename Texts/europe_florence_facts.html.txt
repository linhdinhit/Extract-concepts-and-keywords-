 When to Go  The best time to visit Florence is in the low season, from April to June and in September/October, when the weather is usually good, prices are lower and there are fewer tourists - if you come in July or August, expect a Renaissance Disneyland experience and plenty of sweat in your socks. Early winter, in December, can also be surprisingly pleasant, with crisp air and sunny days and far, far fewer people clogging up the piazzas.     Events  Major festivals include the Explosion of the Cart, when a cart full of fireworks is exploded in front of the duomo on Easter Sunday; and the Feast of St John the Baptist, the patron saint of the city, on 24 June. The lively Calcio Storico, featuring football matches played in 16th century costume, is held in June in Piazza della Signoria and ends with a fireworks display over Piazzale Michelangelo.  The public holidays in Florence are: Anno Nuovo (New Year's Day), 1 January; Befana (Epiphany), 6 January; Venerdi Santo (Good Friday) & Pasquetta/Giorno dopo Pasqua (Easter Monday), March/April; Giorno Della Liberazione (Liberation Day), 25 April; Giorno del Lavoro (Labour Day), 1 May; Assunzione (Feast of the Assumtion), 15 August; Ognissanti (All Saints' Day), 1 November; Concezione Immaculata (Feast of the Immaculate Conception), 8 December; Natale (Christmas Day), 25 December; Festa di Santo Stefano (St Stephen's/Boxing Day), 26 December.
