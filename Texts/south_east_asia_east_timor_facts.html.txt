The current answer is when East Timor is back on its feet. When that is the case, the best time to visit is just after the wet season, around late April to June/July, when the countryside is green. The hottest months are October and November. Travel is certainly possible but difficult during the December-April wet season, when many roads are washed away.     Events  Like everything in East Timor, public holidays are under revision. Christian dates and Catholic festivals form the basis of the calendar, with new public holidays commemorating such landmark dates as the referendum of 30 August 1999 and the UN liberation. Holidays include New Year's Day (1 January), Good Friday (late March/early April), Assumption Day (15 August), Consultation Day (30 August), Liberation Day (20 September), Santa Cruz Day (12 November, commemorating the cemetery massacre at the Santa Cruz church) and Christmas Day (25 December). It's a good bet that 20 May - the date of independence in 2002 - will be a national holiday too.
