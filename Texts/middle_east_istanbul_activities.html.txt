 Activities  Istanbul is a city for walking and gazing. It's possible to see all the prime sights of the old city in one day, but instead of whirling around like a dervish, it's far better to visually divide and conquer the city's attractions by means of a number of planned walks. Istanbul isn't known for its golfing facilities, but there are a few courses close by if you're keen. The best swimming options are a day trip to Kilyos or Sile, or the closer Kizil Adalar (Princes' Islands). Most of Istanbul's pool facilities are privately owned and expensive; try sweet-talking reception staff at one of the big hotels into letting you use the pool. Gyms tend to be testosterone-fuelled, no-go-zones for women, with limited equipment - find a hotel gym instead.  Turks have perfected the art of socialising, and game playing is an important ingredient. Any tea garden should be able to come up with a backgammon board for free if you ask, though if you want to play billiards or bowling you'll need to head to Beyoglu. It's not exactly sporty, but sitting and yakking around a narglieh is a quintessential Middle Eastern experience. Even if you're not a smoker you may be lured by the fruity and flowery tobacco concoctions. Shopping in the thousands of shops of the Kapali Carsi (Grand Bazaar) in Beyazit, and Misir Carsisi (the Egyptian market or Spice Bazaar) in Eminonu qualifies as exercise. And don't forget to try one of the many hamams (Turkish steam baths) to purge your pores.
