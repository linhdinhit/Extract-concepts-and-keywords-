 Activities  There are hundreds of islands off both coasts of Panama, and because the coasts are just an hour's drive apart, you could easily spend the morning snorkeling in the Caribbean Sea and the afternoon swimming in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the best snorkeling and diving to be found in Central America can be found in the protected waters beside Panama's Coiba Island. Divers looking for something different might want to consider diving in the Panama Canal; not only are there wrecks to explore but also all kinds of submerged equipment left by the French when they worked on the railroad many decades ago. Surfers should check out Santa Catalina Beach, on the Azuero Peninsula, which periodically sees waves with 6m (20ft) faces, though they're usually hovering around 3m (10ft).  Fishing enthusiasts will be pleased to know that more deep-sea fishing records have been set at Pi as Bay, on the Pacific coast, than anywhere else in the world. You can see sea turtles in large numbers along both Panamanian coasts, although the Kunas' habit of lopping their heads off with machetes and eating them is taking a heavy toll. Cana, deep in the heart of Parque Nactional Darien, is birding nirvana, and what's more, you're likely to find yourself alone as you take in the great green, blue-and-yellow, red-and-green and chestnut-fronted macaws.
