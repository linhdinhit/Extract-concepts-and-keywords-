 Activities  There's not a lot of nature hospitable to human activity in Qatar, so visitors keen for a bit of a workout - be it in the gym, on the tennis court or in the pool - should head for one of Doha's big hotels, most of which have health clubs. These are generally open to non-guests for a small fee. South of Doha, there are beaches along the road to Umm Said, but they're nothing to write home about. Desert excursions (or 'wadi bashing') are a great way to wile away the time in Qatar - most head for areas south-west of Doha along the road to Salwa.
