 Attractions  Top of your museums list should be the outstanding Musee d'Aquitaine (Museum of Aquitaine), which illustrates 25,000 years of Bordeaux' history and ethnography. The prehistoric period is represented by a number of exceptional artifacts, including several stone carvings of women. A detailed, English-language catalogue can be borrowed (with a deposit) at the ticket counter. The museum is at 20 cours Pasteur.  If you plan to visit more than one of Bordeaux' great museums, take advantage of the city's free Carte Bordeaux Decouverte, available at the tourist office. You pay full price for the first museum you visit (or walking tour you take) and then, for visits to other museums you qualify for the reduced-price fee usually reserved for under-25s and over-60s. It's a great deal!
