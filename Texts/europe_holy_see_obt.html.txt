 Off the Beaten Track  One of Rome's four patriarchal basilicas, Santa Maria Maggiore dates back to the 5th century. The main facade was added in the 18th century, preserving the glorious 13th-century mosaics of the earlier facade. With a baroque interior and a Romanesque bell tower, the basilica's most notable feature is a cycle of mosaics from the 5th century that decorate the arch and nave, depicting biblical scenes. The sumptuously decorated Sistine chapel, last on the right, contains the tombs of popes Sixtus V and Pius V. The basilica is about 8km (5mi) east of the Vatican, just west of the Stazione Termini in Rome.
