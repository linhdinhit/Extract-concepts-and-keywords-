But because Madagascar experiences wide climatic variation, the central highlands can still be pleasant during summer while the east coast gets most of its rain between June and September.     Events  Madagascar has a host of holidays and festivals to cover most tastes and agendas. The usual Christian holidays like Easter and Christmas are celebrated, as well as Insurrection Day (29 March, to celebrate the rebellion against the French in 1947); Organisation of African Unity Day (25 May); Anniversary Day (8 May) and Republic Day (30 December).  In March, Alahamady Be is the low key Malagasy New Year. The  Donia, a traditional music festival, is held on Nosy Be in May-June (the date varies);  Fisemana is a ritual purification ceremony that the Antakarana people undertake in June; and  Famadihana (the 'turning of the bones' burial ceremony) takes place from June to September.
