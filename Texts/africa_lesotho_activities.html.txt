 Activities  One of the most popular and exciting activities for travellers to Lesotho is pony trekking on the tough, sure-footed Basotho ponies. There are several trekking centres, though the one located on God Help Me Pass has a certain allure, if only for the chance of t-shirts.  Along the same lines, but without the safety of the cliff-climbing ponies, is hiking. With landscapes reminiscent of the Tibetan plateau (apparently), the hikes are dangerous and the weather freezing and treacherous. Be well prepared, bring all equipment with you and don't make Lesotho your first hiking experience.  Enjoying the great Lesotho outdoors doesn't have to mean being rescued from a ravine, however, with bird-watching and trout fishing among the more sedate pleasures. Nearly 300 bird species is pretty impressive for a landlocked country, with raptors being particularly prevalent. A fishing licence is required from the Ministry of Livestock for a nominal fee, and bag and size limits apply.
