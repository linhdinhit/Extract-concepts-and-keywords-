 Off the Beaten Track  Ever wondered where the Eagles got their inspiration for 'Hotel California'? Or where punk veteran Iggy Pop hangs his leather trousers during cold winters? This small town holds all the answers, as well as some rarely visited beaches and a prolific artists' colony. The  Hotel California itself has a dubious claim to the song, but with handy access to the beach who cares. Mr Pop, however, is not so accessible, keeping his home a well-guarded secret.  On the outskirts of town there are ruins of several old mills, including Molino El Progreso and Molino Cerro Verde, which are all evidence that the town was once a thriving rural center. The colorful murals at Centro Cultural Todosante o reflect the nationalistic and revolutionary aesthetics of the 1930s, featuring dogmatic slogans like 'Vigor in mind and muscle' and 'Emancipation of the rural spirit'. For two days in late January, the region's many artists open up their studios for visitors to mark the Festival de Artes.  The easiest way to get to Todos Santos is to take the 1.5-hour bus ride from the stop at the corner of Her ico Colegio Militar and Zaragoza in Cabo San Lucas.
