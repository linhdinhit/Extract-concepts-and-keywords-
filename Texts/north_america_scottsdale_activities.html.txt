 Activities  Scottsdale's sunny disposition makes it a perfect locale for those who like to break golf clubs over their knees while taking a walk in the park. There are about 125 golf courses in a city of about 200,000. This means there are more golf courses per capita in Scottsdale than just about anywhere else in the world. Some of these courses are best left to those skilled enough to make a living playing golf, but most of them are of a high enough standard to challenge the rest of us, who make a living so that we can play golf.  Scottsdale is surrounded by the beauties of the rugged Sonoran Desert, including the Tonto National Forest Four Peaks area and the Superstition Mountains, perfect playgrounds for outdoor lovers and trekkers. There are many tour companies offering anything from ecotours to drives in a high-performance Hummer, but a visit to the local visitor information center, a good pair of hiking boots and lots of fresh water is all one needs to make like Lawrence of Arabia and head off on your very own desert expedition.  Scottsdale's art galleries are not just a great way of seeing great contemporary art - they're a perfect opportunity to see and be seen by some of the country's most fashion-conscious art afficionados. Art lovers will be beguiled by the abundance of art, including Native American art galleries.
