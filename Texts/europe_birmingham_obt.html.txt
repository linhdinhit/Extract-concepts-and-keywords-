 Off the Beaten Track  It's not as complicated as building a steam engine, but for some the balti has been as much of a life-changing experience: thank you Birmingham. The curry whose origins are Kashmiri-Pakistani was first mixed here by an immigrant using a special pan. His culinary genius was soon appreciated by the masses, and Birmingham's balti credentials were set. The Balti Mile of Sparbrook, Sparkhill and Balsall Heath is home to over 50 balti restaurants packed into three streets 2mi (3.25km) south of the city centre. There are also shops selling kitchenware, such as balti bowls, and Indian-style dresses.
