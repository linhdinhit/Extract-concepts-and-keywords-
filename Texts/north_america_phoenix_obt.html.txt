 Off the Beaten Track  If the strip-mall chintz of small-town Arizona leaves you dry, drop in on Flagstaff, a cultural oasis in an otherwise arid landscape. The historic downtown area, harking back to the town's early days as a railroad whistle stop, comes as a welcome relief from the region's dusty motels and truckstop diners. In this neighborhood, antique inns sidle up against vegetarian cafes and you're more likely to hear strains of a local jazz combo than any rumble of RV traffic. And as the novelty of nontouristy downtown wears thin, there's always a visit to the Lowell Observatory, where in 1930 the planet Pluto was discovered, or a stroll through the 200 blissfully green acres (80ha) of the local arboretum. Flagstaff is also the region's gateway city to the Grand Canyon and - nostalgic Nat 'King' Cole fans take note - a stop along historic Route 66.  From Phoenix, you can drive north to Flagstaff in under three hours along I-17. The cities are also connected by daily flights and buses. From Flagstaff, the southern rim of the Grand Canyon is more than 100 miles (160km) distant, which makes daytrips to the canyon from Phoenix impractical.
