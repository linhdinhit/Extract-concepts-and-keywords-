 Activities  Yemen has some fabulous areas for trekking, but keep in mind that you're on your own - there's no organised trekking in the country, and that means no marked trails and no maps. Because the country is sparsely populated, you'll need to be self-sufficient. The Haraz mountains or al-Mahwit are both good areas because they're densely populated and the people are friendly. East of San'a camping is not welcome at all.  Although Yemenis don't really get into water sports, the expat population has found some pretty good diving spots. The Yemeni seas are rich in sealife, and popular with people who either want to gawk or eat. You won't be able to rent equipment, so bring your own.
