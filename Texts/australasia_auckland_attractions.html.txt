 Attractions  A combination of war memorial and museum, this is Auckland's must-see attraction, a first stop for insight into the country and its peoples. It includes several rooms dedicated to the art and culture of the Maori and Pacific Islanders, a star feature of which is a war canoe from the 1830s. A Maori cultural performance takes place at 11 am and 1:30 pm daily.  An entire floor is dedicated to New Zealand's natural history. Among other things, this excellent display has interactive consoles that allow you to discover what New Zealand's birds look and sound like, and an impressive collection of dinosaur skeletons. The children's discovery centre is a wonderland with all manner of activities, games and interactive displays. The top floor is a war memorial, housing reminders of wars past, including the exhibition 'Scars on the Heart'.  The lovely museum building is located in Auckland Domain, the city's oldest, largest and most attractive park, with expansive lawns and landscaped gardens. From Parnell Rd, where both the Explorer Bus and Link bus stop, it's a short walk to the museum.
