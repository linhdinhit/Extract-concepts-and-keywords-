 Off the Beaten Track  Lost amid the rolling forests of the Cordillera de la Costa, some 60km (37mi) west of Caracas, is the unusual mountain town of Colonia Tovar. Founded in 1843 by a group of German settlers, the town effectively shielded itself from any outside contact for almost a century: A lack of roads restricted access, and rigid social mores meant that the inhabitants remained exclusively tied to their own culture (marriage, for instance, was prohibited unless to another member of the colony). Only in the 1940s was the Spanish language introduced; a serviceable road wasn't built until 1963. Today, Colonia Tovar is a lovely town of produce markets and arts-and-craft stores and is still unmistakably German. Much of the original architecture remains, and foods, such as bread and sausage, continue to be made according to hoary German recipes.
