 Activities  The locals are big on ice skating, especially on frozen canals and the Museumplein pond in winter; when nature doesn't comply, try the Jaap Edenbaan indoor and outdoor rinks instead. Cycling is one of the main ways to get around - Amsterdam is wonderfully flat. Jogging is popular, particularly in the Vondelpark, and the Amsterdamse Bos has several walking and jogging trails for serious exercise. At Het Twiske you can walk, bike or rent boats.  The Dutch are into sailing in a big way and windsurfing is almost a national sport. On weekends a fleet of restored flat-bottomed boats crisscross the watery expanse of the IJsselmeer. There are indoor pools and summer outdoor pools for swimming, and saunas for relaxing in afterward. You can pump iron or do aerobics at various gyms around the city. Tennis and squash can be played, bungy jumping is possible and intellectuals can make do with exercising their minds at chess.
