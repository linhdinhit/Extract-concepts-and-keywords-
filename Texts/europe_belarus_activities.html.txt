 Activities  Nature lovers should visit the Belavezhskaja Pushcha Nature Reserve, on the western border with Poland. It's the largest area of ancient forest in Europe and has substantial herds of the once near-extinct European bison. If you've got your own car, the Blue Lakes area in the north of Belarus is renowned for its natural beauty, and is a popular camping and hiking area. The country's network of lakes and streams make for great fishing.
