 Activities  The Branson/Lakes Area is home to three scenic lakes, offering water enthusiasts opportunities for swimming, boating, sailing, scuba diving, para-sailing and fishing. Nestled in the scenic Ozark Mountains, access to these lakes is easy - Lake Taneycomo flows through the city itself, Table Rock Lake is a ten-minute drive from the central district, while Bull Shoals Lake, about a 30-minute drive away, is a little more secluded. The nearby Ozark Mountains, State Parks and National Forests are prefect for hiking, biking, kayaking, spelunking and camping, and there are several tour companies in town that specialize in guided forest trips. For the golfing enthusiast there are over eight courses in the Branson area. Branson ranks in the top 10 in the nation for the number of factory outlet stores so it's no surprise that shopping is consistently ranked as one of the most popular activities by visitors.
