 When to Go  Climatically, the ideal times to show up in Andaluc a are April to June and September to the first half of October - when temperatures are pleasantly warm, and you'll avoid the winter torrents. Culturally, spring festivals present Seville at its prime, but room rates rise like the mercury does in summer. In July and August, when daytime temperatures typically reach a sweltering 36 C (97 F), there's a crush of Spanish and foreign tourists, and locals sensibly flee the city for breezier coastal climes. From December to February, average daily highs hover around 16 C (61 F). Rain falls mainly from October to March (50-100mm or 2-4in per month, comparable to rainfall in London).     Events  Seville's solemn Semana Santa processions, during the week leading up to Easter, and its famously festive Feria de Abril, the fair which follows a week or two later, are two of Spain's most exciting to-dos. Other special events include the Cabalgata de los Reyes Magos in January, featuring a sweet parade of floating floats; Corpus Christi processions from the Catedral in late May/early June; and the biannual Bienal de Flamenco festival in September, held during even-numbered years.
