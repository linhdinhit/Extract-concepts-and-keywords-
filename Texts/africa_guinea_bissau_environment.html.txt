 Environment  At just over 36,000 sq km (14,000 sq mi), Guinea-Bissau is one of the smaller West African countries (about the same size as Switzerland). The north of the country borders the Casamance region of Senegal, and the east and south edge the Republic of Guinea. Off the coast are the paradise islands of the Bijagos Archipelago. Inlets indent the flat coastal areas, which are covered with mangrove swamps, low-lying jungle and grassland. The highest point of the country (300m/1000ft above sea level) is by the Guinea border. The lowest areas are occasionally submerged by high tides; floods have been known to cover a third of the country.  Increased rice production in these flood-traps has incurred the worrying destruction of mangrove swamps, and groundnut (peanut) production is slowly ridding the soil of essential nutrients. Maize and other crops are also grown on the inland savanna. The islands of the archipelago are home to woodland and mangroves. Guinea-Bissau's wildlife includes birds, monkeys, chimpanzees, elephants, lizards and butterflies. The Orango Islands National Park and the proposed Poilao Marine Park are within Guinea-Bissau's premier protected area, the Bolama-Bijagos Biosphere Reserve. The Cacheu Natural Park near Senegal and the Cantanhez Natural Park in the south protect mangroves and forest. Near Buba, the Cafada Natural Park shelters a freshwater wetland area. These national parks have little or no facilities for tourists.  Guinea-Bissau's rainy season is from June to October, with August the wettest month. The rainfall is twice as heavy on the coast as on the mainland, and conditions are hot and humid. You can dry out in November to February, when it's cooler and there's a pleasant sea breeze on the islands and the coast. Sweat levels in March to May are seriously antisocial.
