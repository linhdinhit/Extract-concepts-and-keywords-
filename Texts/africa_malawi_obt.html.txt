 Off the Beaten Track  The rolling hills of the Nyika Plateau, averaging about 2000m (6560ft) above sea level, are covered with a mix of mopane grassland and mimbo woodland. Other areas are covered in dense evergreen forests, and there are pockets of damp grassy bog. The park is famous for its wildflowers (including 120 species of orchid), which grow like mad after the rains (November to April), and attract a broad array of wildlife. Most common are the large roan antelope and the smaller reedbuck; you'll also see zebra, warthog, blue monkey (in the woodlands) and over 250 species of bird.  Many people see the park from a car. Although you're not allowed to enter the park on foot, once you're inside you can stroll as much as you like - though you'll have to be accompanied by a park ranger for hikes of more than a few kilometres. It's also possible to ride a horse across the grasslands, allowing you to get closer to the game than in a car or on foot.  The main entrance to the park is at the Thazima Gate, in the southwestern corner, which is connected by dirt road to the nearest town, Rumphi. Rumphi is a few kilometres from the main north-south highway, and about 55km (35mi) north of Mzuzu. The easiest way to get there is by car, but there's a daily bus between Mzuzu and Chitipa that runs through the park.
