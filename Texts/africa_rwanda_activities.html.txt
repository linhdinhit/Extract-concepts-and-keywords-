 Activities   Gorilla tracking is the famous activity of choice in the Parc Nacional des Volcans, where Dian Fossey spent 18 years studying the impressive and fascinating beasts until her murder by poachers in 1985. This national park re-opened in July 1999 after years of civil violence in the surrounding area and is once again the place in East Africa for observing mountain gorillas. A military unit stands guard over the park and has so far ensured the safety of foreign visitors from groups such as the extremist Hutu militias who killed eight tourists in Uganda's Bwindi National Park in March 1999.  The safety of trekkers in the Parc Nacional des Volcans, however, is a much more ethereal concept. Though there are a number of possibilities for scaling the area's volcanic heights - ranging from four-hour return trips to two-day summit blitzes - Rwandan authorities do not currently allow treks up the slopes due to rebel factions lying low on the mountains, not to mention the odd land mine or two. But with any luck, it won't be too long before the routes up Visoke, Karisimbi, Sabinyo and the other spectacular, view-ridden cones are re-opened.
