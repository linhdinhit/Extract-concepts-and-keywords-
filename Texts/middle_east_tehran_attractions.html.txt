 Attractions  This museum houses a marvellous collection including ceramics, stone figures and carvings dating from around the 5th millenium BC. Many of the impressive relics are taken from excavations at Persepolis, Isma'il Abad, Shush, Rey and Turang Tappeh and will probably mean more to you if you come here after you've visited the archaeological sites. The entrance fee allows you to visit the Museum of the Islamic Period next door, which contains Islamic art such as calligraphy, ceramics, woodcarvings and textiles.
