 Activities  Canadians sure do love their outdoors and in this regard, Montrealers are no different. The city has fantastic parks and gardens. The huge Parc du Mont Royal offers outdoor action aplenty: walking, picnicking (it is a pursuit!), jogging, horseback riding, bicycling and frisbeeing. If that isn't exhausting enough, in the winter there's ice-skating, tobogganing and cross-country skiing.  It isn't surprising to discover that Montreal has about 400km (250mi) of bike paths, including one that links Vieux (Old) Montreal with the Parc des les and the historic suburb of Lachine along the city's old canal. On the le Notre Dame, the Grand Prix track becomes a haven for inline skating, while its summer-use rowing basin becomes a monster ice-skating rink in the winter. There is also swimming at the city's Olympic Park Centre Aquatic and amazing boating, canoeing and kayaking to be had at the beautiful Parc Mille les in Laval, north of Montreal.
