 When to Go  From April to December the coastal fog blankets the sun in a fine, grey mist. From January to March, daytime temperatures are warm but the humidity can be uncomfortable. Rainfall in Lima is very low all year round. Perhaps the best time to visit is around March and April, when the sun is still shining, or in early December, before it gets too sticky.     Events  Lima goes off on 30 August, when it celebrates the Santa Rosa de Lima, one giant street procession honouring the patron saint of Lima and the Americas. El Senor de los Milagros (Lord of the Miracles) is heralded by a huge religious procession where all the people wear purple. In late July the entire country is on the go as Peruvians celebrate Fiestas Patrias (Peru's independence) and Lima is no exception with lively street parties and festivals.
