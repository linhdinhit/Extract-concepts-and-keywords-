 Attractions  At the doorstep of Anchorage, this gorgeous park stretches its haunches across a half-million acres; it's the second-largest state preserve in Alaska and the third-largest state park in America. For eagle-spotting, vista-viewing and wildflower-meandering, there are many picturesque pockets of nature to explore here. Excellent mountain biking begins at the Hillside area trailheads, which you can reach via bus; the buses are now equipped with bicycle racks.  Chugach is one of the most heavily used parks in Alaska, offering a wide variety of developed trails suitable for all levels of hiking. Flattop Mountain is a popular intro to elevated Alaska, or a week can easily be spent traversing trail-less areas, and exploring one valley and ridgeline after another. These wilds are close to the city, but they are wilds nonetheless; come prepared.
