 Activities  There's good rafting and kayaking a few hours by bus from Tashkent - you'll find flat water on the Syr-Darya and Angren rivers and more exciting stretches on the Ugan, Chatkal and Pskem. The peak rafting season is in September and October. The recreation zone of Chimgan, three hours by bus north-east of Tashkent, is a popular centre for winter sports, though it runs a poor second to those near Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) and Almaty (Kazakstan).  There are fine walks in the Angren River Valley, four hours by bus west of Tashkent; the canyon of the upper Angren, in particular, is spectacular. There are also good hiking trails from the Uzbekistan pocket of Shakhimardan, in the Pamir Alay Range south of the Ferghana Valley, all of which head into surrounding Kyrgyzstan.
