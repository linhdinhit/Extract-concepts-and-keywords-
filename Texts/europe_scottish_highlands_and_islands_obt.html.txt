 Off the Beaten Track  If you venture north to the Orkney archipelago, you will be rewarded by the greatest concentration of prehistoric archaeological sites in Europe. Foremost among these is Skara Brae; a 5000-year-old village that was covered by sand until it was exposed by a severe storm in 1850. It is the best-preserved Neolithic village in Europe: even the stone furniture - beds, boxes and dressers - survived, offering an incredible insight into the thriving communities that existed in Stone Age Orkney. No wonder it has been classified as a World Heritage site.  Nearby is the Ring of Brodgar, a wide circle of standing stones raised some 4500 years ago. Thirty-six of the original 60 stones are still standing among the heather, and some of them are more than 16ft (5m) tall. It's an impressive sight and a powerful place. Among the natural wonders in the area is the Yesnaby Castle sea stack, a rock tower similar to the Old Man of Hoy. It is situated off the Yesnaby Coast, perhaps the most beautiful section of cliff line in Orkney. Watch out during the nesting season as seabirds will dive-bomb you to protect their nests.
