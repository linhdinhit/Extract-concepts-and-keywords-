 Environment  Brunei consists of two separate areas, approximately 30km (19mi) apart. Both areas are bordered by the South China Sea to the north, and by the Malaysian province of Sarawak on all other sides. Western Brunei is composed of hilly lowlands; the eastern part consists of a coastal plain rising to a height of 1841m (6038ft) at Bukit Pagon. Most of Brunei is jungle. Only 15 per cent of the country is cultivated, resulting in Brunei having to import 80 per cent of its food requirements.  Brunei doesn't have marked wet and dry seasons. Rainfall occurs throughout the year, but is heaviest between September and January. Temperatures are consistently between 24 C (75 F) and 31 C (88 F). Average humidity is 79%, making it a pretty warm and sticky place.
