 Activities  Cura ao doesn't have the long beaches typical of other Caribbean islands: many are short of sand and have been beefed up with imported grains. But there are small natural beaches in the coves on the leeward (southern and western) coasts that are great for swimming and sunbathing. The best beach isn't on the island at all - it's on Klein Cura ao, an uninhabited cay a few miles off the southeastern coast.   Snorkelers and divers can choose among many sites on the leeward coast. In the north, Playa Kalki has a sheltered cove with calm, clear water and a gentle slope that's good for beginners. Also check out Playa Lagun and Knipbaai. In the south, a nearly intact tugboat lies just a few meters down off Caracas Bay. There's a wall with large sheet corals nearby.  For hikers, the place to start is Christoffel National Park, where trails lead through mahogany forests and past rock faces covered with Amerindian petroglyphs. The Hato Caves, on the northern side of the island, offer great spelunking. You can examine fossilized fish and feel the cool spray of underground waterfalls.
