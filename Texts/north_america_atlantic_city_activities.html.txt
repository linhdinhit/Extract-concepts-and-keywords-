 Activities  Atlantic City is not the place to visit if you're into the outdoors. The most burning of calories you'll achive will be getting out of bed and slouching in front of a slot machine. The city's rules and regulations conspire to keep it this way. While the Boardwalk is a good spot, in theory, for cycling, bikes are only allowed between the hours of 6-10 am.  If you want some exercise, you're better off leaving Atlantic City and heading for the peaceful Pine Barrens, where there's no shortage of hiking in the huge pine forest. In Egg Harbor, you can rent equipment to canoe and kayak through the Pines. Wildwood's coast has some decent beaches from which people parasail. Whalewatching trips run from North Wildwood and Cape May throughout the summer.
