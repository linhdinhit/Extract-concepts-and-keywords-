 Off the Beaten Track  Climb to the top of this 590m (1935ft) hill, around 10km (6mi) northeast of the Altstadt, and be rewarded by panoramic vistas of Frankfurt's skyline and the entire Rhine-Main region - a sea of rooftops, tower blocks, skyscrapers, trees and hills. The steep hillsides are planted with Frankfurt's only vineyard, and those manicured vegetable gardens you can see are rented allotments fastidiously fussed over by Frankfurt's high-rise dwellers. Quench all that feasting of eyes with a well-earned apple wine at the obligatory beer garden before heading back to the throngs - in winter you can sled down the hill if you're willing to take the risk.
