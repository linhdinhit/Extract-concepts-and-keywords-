 Off the Beaten Track  This sandy island, 19km (12mi) off the coast of Fremantle, is home to small indigenous marsupials known as quokkas. These were mistakenly identified as rats in 1696 by the Dutch explorer de Vlamingh, who named the island 'Rats Nest'. The Rottnest settlement was established as a prison for Aborigines in the 19th century, but by 1920 the prison had fallen into disuse and the island had become an escape for Perth society. There is virtually no motorised traffic on the island - bicycle is the main means of transport. The beaches are superb with some of the southernmost coral reefs in the world and crystal-clear waters.  There are a couple of places to stay, including a campground, on Rottnest, and a few restaurants. You can get to Rottnest by plane from Perth, or by ferry from Perth or Fremantle.
