 Environment  Just 60 miles (100 km) north of Venezuela, Grenada is the largest of the three small islands that make up the Caribbean nation of the same name. Completing the threesome are Carriacou and Petit Martinique, the most southerly of a long string of coral islands stretching north to neighboring St Vincent. Trinidad and Tobago are Grenada's only Caribbean neighbors to the south.  Grenada has a varied ecosystem of rainforests, montane thickets, elfin woodlands and lowland dry forests. Mona monkeys swing within wooded areas, and opossums, armadillos, mongoose, pelicans, osprey hawks and rarely seen tree boas roam throughout the island. Among the endangered species are sea turtles and hook-billed kites.  Temperatures in Grenada are balmy year round, with daily highs averaging around 80 F (30 C). The rainy season lasts from June to November, and rain falls on average on 22 days a month during this period. Even in the driest months, between January and April, it rains 12 days a month - which accounts for the island's lush vegetation.
