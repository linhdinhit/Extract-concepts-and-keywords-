 Off the Beaten Track  Kuba is 165km (105mi) north of Baku. Once the capital of a small khanate in the 18th century, its chief feature these days is that it's very photogenic, especially in spring when its many orchards are in bloom. You can have a look at the town's 16th century fortress and 19th century mosques and bathhouse.
