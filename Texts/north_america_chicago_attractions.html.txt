 Attractions  The Art Institute, on the eastern side of the Loop, provides reason alone to visit Chicago. One of the world's premier galleries, the Art Institute has found generous patronage among Chicago's wealthy. Their contributions have funded a magnificent collection that spans 5000 years of art. The bronze lions flanking the steps are Chicago icons.
