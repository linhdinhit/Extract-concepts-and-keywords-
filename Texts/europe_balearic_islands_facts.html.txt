For much of this time you'll be subject to the full tourapalooza experience - crowded beaches, higher prices and a shortage of accommodation. These annoyances are offset by the Balearic's fun-in-the-sun Mediterranean climate: most days during summer the temperature hovers around 27 C (85 F) making it perfect for developing that euro-lifestyle tan.  To avoid the crowds and save money come in May-June or September-October; the weather is still pleasant and warm but the crowds are thinner and accommodation is thicker on the ground. Winter (December, January and February) can be a peaceful time as the lack of beach weather keeps the hordes away. Even in winter, though, you're bound to get one or two days of the much-touted 300 days-out-of-the-year worth of sunshine.     Events  Among the typical festivities that are held in the different towns and villages of the Balearic Islands, one of the most important is the Fiesta of San Juan at Ciutadella around June 18, 23 and 24. The festivities of La Devallament at Pollensa (March 23), Sa Pobla (January 16 and 17) in honour of San Antonio Abad, and the Day of La Beata at Santa Margarita (September 3), are all of interest to tourists. Ibiza celebrates its festivities on the days between July 30 and August 5.
