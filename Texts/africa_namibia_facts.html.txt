It's best to avoid Namib-Naukluft Park and Etosha National Park in the extreme heat between December and March. Resort areas are busiest during both Namibian and South African school holidays, which usually take place from mid-December to mid-January, late-April to early June, and late-August to mid-September.     Events  A big event to watch for is Maherero Day, on the weekend nearest 26 August, when the Herero people gather in traditional dress at Okahandja (just north of Windhoek) for a memorial service to the chiefs killed in the Khoi-Khoi and German wars. In October there's a similar event for the Hereros in Omaruru (north-west of Windhoek) to honour their chief Zeraua. Independence Day on 21 March is celebrated with feasts and festivities all over Namibia. The Windhoek Karnival held over a week in late April/early May is a big social event for city sophisticates, as is the Küste Karnival at Swakopmund in late August or early September, and the Windhoek Agricultural, Commercial and Industrial Show in late September. Oktoberfest, with all its beer swilling and sausage sizzling, is vigourously celebrated throughout the country in late October.
