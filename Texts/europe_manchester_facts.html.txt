 When to Go  April-September is the optimal period weather-wise to head up north, though bear in mind that July-August is peak tourist time. Visit at the end of August and you can join the 500,000 revellers kicking up their heels in Manchester's GayFest parade. The marginal months of March and October are worth considering; it can be cold and wet, but then again so can July. November-February is grim, cold and dark, and best left to its own devices.     Events  Manchester's major festivities focus on the city's large gay and lesbian community. Britain's biggest queer arts fest, the biennial It's Queer Up North (IQUP), hits town around late August. And every year's a good one to join in the annual GayFest shenanigans, with a parade held on the August bank holiday weekend. The family-oriented Manchester Show is held in July, with a day-long programme of music, dance and entertainment.  Most businesses close on public holidays such as New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day Bank Holiday (the first Monday in May), Spring Bank Holiday (the last Monday in May), Summer Bank Holiday (the last Monday in August), Christmas Day and Boxing Day (26 December).
