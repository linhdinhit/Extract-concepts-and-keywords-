 Activities  Niger is more for looking than doing, but in the south, where the river cuts across the country, you can go sailing in a pirogue (dugout canoe) down the Niger River. Up north, providing rebel skirmishes have not closed the area down, you can go on organised tours, or camel treks, through the mountainous region of Agadez, and into the vast terrain of the Teneree Desert.
