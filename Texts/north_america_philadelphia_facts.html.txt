 When to Go  Philadelphia can get unbearably humid in the summer and freezing cold in the winter, making spring and fall, which are generally characterized by warm days and cool nights, the best time to visit the city. If you can stand the crowds, Philadelphia comes alive with patriotic frenzy and fireworks every 4th of July (Independence Day).     Events   Mummers Parade on New Year's Day sees 30,000 men wearing sequins, feathers, makeup and risque costumes spectacularly strut their way around town accompanied by accordions and glockenspiels. The event's been taking place since the 1700s. Penn Relays in April is one of the world's oldest, largest and best amateur athletic carnivals, held at the University of Pennsylvania. The Jambalaya Jam in May is a 3-day celebration of Creole and Cajun food and New Orleans music at Penn's Landing. You better believe that the birthplace of the Declaration of Independence gets down on Independence Day; the Philadelphia Freedom Festival sets off fireworks, parades and concerts during the first week of July.
