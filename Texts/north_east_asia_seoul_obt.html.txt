 Off the Beaten Track   Panmunjeom was just a small farming community before it became the focus of continuing peace negotiations between North and South. Technically, the Korean War never ended, making the ceasefire since 1953's Armistice Treaty (which Seoul never signed) the longest in history. The so-called 'demilitarised zone', or DMZ, is hardly demilitarised today, with two armies bristling with weapons glaring at each other across a stretch of mined, electrified and barbed-wired no-man's land.  The attractions don't amount to much, and include a conference room with the demarcation line running down the centre of the table, the Freedom Bridge and the Bridge of No Return (depending on which way you're going and where your politics lie), as well as a few touristy sights like Freedom House. Perhaps the point of making the trip is not so much to see these places as to breathe in the almost palpable tension of a front line in a continuing cold war.  You can only reach Panmunjeom by joining a tour group. Your Korean guide will take you to Camp Bonifas, where you can play slot machines, presumably to boost the army's coffers. An American soldier briefs the tourists, puts on a short slide show and accompanies the group to the Joint Security Area of Panmunjeom, as Korean nationals are forbidden entry. The tours are popular, so you'll probably have to book ahead in Seoul.
