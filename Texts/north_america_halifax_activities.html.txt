 Activities  Halifax offers a plethora of organized tours; naturally enough, boats feature, but hiking and even ghost walks can be arranged as well. If you want to get a little closer to Halifax's harbor, you can get into some ocean kayaking (either on your own or as part of a tour) or try scuba diving. There are about 50 wrecks at the mouth of the harbor, and more good diving along the coast. On dry land there's trail walking, rock climbing and cycling, either on your own or with a group.
