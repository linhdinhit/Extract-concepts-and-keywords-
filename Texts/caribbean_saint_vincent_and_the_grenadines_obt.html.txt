 Off the Beaten Track  Most people who've heard of the Grenadines can probably tell you that Mick Jagger and Princess Margaret are neighbors on Mustique - though practically everyone's a neighbor on an island that's only 5 miles (8km) long. Most of the 800 permanent residents work directly or indirectly for those who vacation on the island, which has been privately owned since 1958. Since the 1960s it's become a holiday haven for the rich and famous and, despite its typically dry and hilly Grenadine landscape, it's been successfully planted with coconut palms and citrus trees. The island is managed by the Mustique Company, which runs a village of sorts on Britannia Bay on the western coast that consists of a general store and a handful of boutiques. There's good swimming and snorkeling at Britannia Bay, and the Mustique Company can arrange horseback riding and diving.
