 Off the Beaten Track  This archipelago in the Caribbean Sea lies about 750km (465mi) northwest of the Colombian mainland and only 230km (140mi) east of Nicaragua. The southern group of islands is clustered around the seahorse-shaped San Andres and 90km (55mi) to the north, mountainous Providencia is plopped into the tropical sea. San Andres especially has been affected by a duty-free inspired tourist boom, but the charm and beauty of these islands has been largely retained. The turquoise waters, extensive coral reefs and rich marine life are a paradise for snorkelers and scuba divers while sun-soaked cays make soaking up UVs seem almost healthy. The easy-going life, friendly atmosphere, adequate (although not super-cheap) tourist facilities and general safety make the archipelago a good place to escape from the outside world.  San Andres lies on the cheapest and most convenient route between Central American and Colombia. There are shuttle flights between the archipelago and the mainland, and direct connections from several southern US capitals. There are no regular ferries or boats, but cargo boats and freighters from Panama and Cartagena will often take passengers.
