 Off the Beaten Track  This crocodile-free swimming hole is a very pleasant spot, surrounded by forest. It's about 35km (22mi) east of the city and makes a great break from the heat, but it can get uncomfortably crowded at weekends. Nevertheless, it's a pleasant spot for an excursion; there are short walking tracks and lots of bird life. You can see all sorts of fish and turtles, and tame wallabies graze around the springs.
