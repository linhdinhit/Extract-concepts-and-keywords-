 Activities  With a mild climate and stunning natural surroundings to call their own, Aucklanders are bound to lead a healthy outdoor lifestyle. There are some 80,000 pleasure boats in Auckland, and it's claimed that the city's per capita boat-ownership is the world's highest. As well as boating, the plentiful beaches offer swimming, surfing, wind-surfing, sea kayaking and other water sports. There are excellent, calm bay beaches on the North Shore, including Takapuna and the East Coast Bays, along with the wild surf beaches of the west coast - Karekare, Piha, Te Henga. For a more relaxing view of the harbour, there are plenty of ferry and scenic cruises operating to the North Shore and islands. Auckland also has numerous indoor swimming pools.  In addition to plenty of leafy parks, there are many marked walking trails around the city. These include heritage trails through historic city districts, and coastal and bush trails for tramping (hiking) farther afield. One of the city's great participatory sporting events is the Round the Bays fun-run along Tamaki Drive, held in March. Cycling and inline skating are also popular. In rugby and cricket season, Eden Park is the place to be, and golf can be played all year round at one of twenty courses. And for adrenaline addicts, New Zealand is famous for its extreme sports: there are facilities in and around Auckland for rock climbing and abseiling (including rap jumping - face-down abseiling), paragliding and skydiving, bungy jumping and canyoning.
