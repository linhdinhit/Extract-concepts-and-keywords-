 Environment  Smaller than Belgium, smaller than most Caribbean Islands, smaller than almost anywhere, Liechtenstein is sandwiched between Switzerland to the west and Austria to the east. The 160 sq km (62.4 sq mi) principality has three distinct geographical areas; the Rhine Valley in the west, the edge of the Tirolean Alps in the south-east, and the northern lowlands. Around one fifth of the nation is still forested, and the rest is put to use grazing cattle and sheep or growing vegetables, grapes, wheat and potatoes.  Despite all the mountains, Liechtenstein enjoys a relatively mild climate, modified by a warm, southerly wind (known locally as the Föhn).
