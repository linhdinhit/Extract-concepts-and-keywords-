 Off the Beaten Track  The For t de Fazao lies in the beautiful Malfacassa mountains of central Togo, an area of thickly wooded savannah with a variety of waterfalls, cliffs and rocky hills. Most people come for the wildlife, but the park's been so poorly managed that your chances of seeing anything other than birds and monkeys are slim. If you're lucky, you might catch a glimpse of a waterbuck, duiker, hippo, oribi, buffalo, bush pig, wart hog, hyena, vervet, baboon and - if you're very lucky - maybe an elephant or lion.  Adjoining Fazao is the Malfacassa Zone de Chassse, an excellent area for hiking. From the mountain tops, you can see the countryside roll away for kilometres, and there's a better chance of seeing elephants, especially during the dry season. Two things to watch out for: hungry lions and hunters in the dry season. In the rainy season you won't get shot, but slogging through the muddy forests can be a challenge to your patience. Fazao-Malfacassa lies some 330km (205mi) north of Lome, a seven hour trip by bus.
