 Activities  In true French style, the recreational emphasis in Reunion is on sweat, adventure, and pushing beyond conventional limits. There are established clubs for just about every sort of activity you can imagine. However, more than anything, Reunion's geological history has made it a haven for the serious and occasional trekker. There are dozens of day hikes and multi-day hikes throughout the island. The volcano and high-rugged cirques of Cilaos, Salazie and Mafate are superb. The terrain has also led to an explosion of interest in mountain biking and the appropriate velo tout terrain or VTT is easy to rent for half or full-day excursions. Diving is concentrated around St-Gilles-les-Bains, as is snorkelling, swimming and other water activities. The only surf spots are also around St-Gilles-les-Bains. For adventure seekers, there's the exhilaration of canyoning, challenging you to abseil down rugged gorges and cliffs into water holes or lagoons below.
