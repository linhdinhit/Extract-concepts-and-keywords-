 Activities  If shopping is not providing enough physical exertion there are plenty of other options for shaking it about. Given the polluted waters, none of Singapore's beaches are particularly great for swimming, although there are safe swimming areas at East Coast Park, Sentosa and the other islands. A better option, if you're not staying at a hotel with its own pool, are the excellent public swimming complexes. Further watersport options include windsurfing and sailing off the beaches, while dragonboat racing at the watersports centre is popular with locals and expats alike.   Cycling enthusiasts can take two wheels through the streets or on nature trails.  Singapore has plenty of golf courses, though some are members only or don't allow visitors to play on weekends. Tennis and squash facilities are also readily available.   Walking is still one of the best ways to get around. Singapore is a compact area with many of its star attractions within walking distance of the city district. The inner-city ethnic areas of Chinatown, Little India and Arab St are quickly losing their traditional cultures to drinking bars and venues but they are still fascinating areas to walk through.
