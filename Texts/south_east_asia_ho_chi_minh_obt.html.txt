 Off the Beaten Track  Now a district of the greater city, Cu Chi was the site of intense action during the American war. To see signs of this destruction, you have to dig deep - underground. Not even 40km (25mi) from the city, the area around Cu Chi was nonetheless controlled by the VC through its now-legendary system of tunnels. At the height of the war, the tunnels stretched from Saigon through to the Cambodian border; in Cu Chi district alone there were over 250km (155mi) of tunnels, some several storeys deep. These days, some of the tunnels - enlarged and upgraded - are open to the public, and give a fair idea of the conditions within the system. At their peak, the system of tunnels included kitchens, living areas, hospitals and a network of trap doors to guard against gas and water attacks. Cu Chi town is north-west of Ho Chi Minh City, and is best visited in a hire car or an organised tour. It is not well served by public transport.
