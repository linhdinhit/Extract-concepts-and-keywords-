 Activities  Atlanta doesn't offer a lot in the way of sweating it out - aside from just standing still in summer. The city's 15 mile (24km) bike loop and Piedmont Park's bike paths make for great cycling. If you want to feel the earth under your feet, you can hike through Fernbank Forest, a few miles northeast of downtown.  There are guided walks at the Atlanta History Center and the Atlanta Botanical Garden. You can do a little bit of everything at Stone Mountain Park - ice skate, boat, hike and chase the ducks.
