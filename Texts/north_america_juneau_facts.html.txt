 When to Go  Juneau is part of the coastal rain belt of the Tongass National Forest, but it isn't as wet as some other areas of the belt such as Ketchikan and Sitka. It has a relatively mild climate, and the average annual precipitation is 92in (234cm) in the downtown area and 52in (132cm) in the Mendenhall Valley. The average temperature from June to August is around 55 F (13 C), though in July it's 64 F (18 C) (often reaching 75-80 Fs/23-26 C). Don't come with high expectations, though, a good week during the summer will include three sunny days, two overcast ones and two when you need to pull your rain gear out or duck for cover.  Juneau isn't part of the 'midnight sun' club of northern Alaskan regions, but its summer days are much longer than those in the continental USA. The peak is reached on summer solstice, around June 21, with around 18 hours of daylight time.     Events  As the weather starts to thaw, the music heats up with the week-long Alaska Folk Festival in mid-April, when musicians from around Alaska take the stage. The tunes change slightly for the Juneau Jazz and Classics Festival in the third week of May. Gold Rush Days, a festival of logging and mining events, happens late June. The largest summer festivities, though, are saved up for the 4th of July, when celebrations include a parade, a carnival, fireworks and miles of outdoor meals.
