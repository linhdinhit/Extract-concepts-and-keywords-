 Off the Beaten Track  Miramar is a prestigious residential neighborhood west of Vedado across the R o Almendares. The scene is set by wide avenues occupied by embassies, expensive shops, lavishly restored mansions and the odd abandoned villa thrown in for revolutionary balance. Streams of late-model, mirror-buffed cars cruise the streets while Miami Vice lookalikes gather on the pavement.  Covetous eyes focus on the posh La Maison, an old mansion where you can buy ready-to-wear fashion as well as jewellery, handicrafts and cosmetics. You can't miss it - just look for the fulanos (Cubans with dollars) wielding mobile phones and Raybans. The Museo del Ministerio de Interior nearby is a must for anyone interested in the Cold War antics between Cuba and the USA. Inside is a delightful grabbag of devilish plots (deodorants used as silencers, exploding cigars, soap dishes filled with plastic explosive and the like) designed to assassinate Castro.  The Marina Hemingway, an enormous residential resort, is further west. Each May the marina hosts the Ernest Hemingway International Marlin Fishing Tournament, guaranteed to turn young bucks into old men of the sea.
