 Attractions  St-Denis is an attractive, lively and expensive capital city. Even visitors with a healthy supply of cash may feel a bit alien unless they have local friends to introduce them around the cafe set. St-Denis is known to some as the Paris of the Indian Ocean but unlike Paris, you won't find loads of down-at-heel student travellers struggling to survive on a slim budget. In their place are legions of hopeful workers from Madagascar, Mauritius, the African mainland and the EU - some legal and some not - searching for lucrative employment.  The chic area of town is Le Barachois, St-Denis' promenade venue, which lies at the eastern end of the waterfront. Here are the upmarket bars and sidewalk cafes as well as the H tel Le Saint-Denis, one of the ritziest places to stay. There is also a variety of impressive Creole mansions in St-Denis. The best advice is to wander and see what you discover. Of interest are the Monument aux Morts, the tall victory monument; the H tel de Ville (town hall), considered by many to be the city's most beautiful building; the Cathedrale de St-Denis; and the Prefecture, which was begun in 1735 and served as the Compagnie des Indes headquarters. The Grand Marche is the main handicraft market, featuring a mishmash of items for sale such as Malagasy wooden handicrafts, spices, baskets and furniture.  The hill districts behind St-Denis offer great views over the town and are starting points for treks to La Roche Ecrite, a high peak often obscured by clouds. Although it isn't technically in the Cirque de Mafate, it does offer a spectacular view of the lower cirque. Dawn is the best time to see it.
