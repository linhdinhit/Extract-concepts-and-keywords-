 Environment  The Maltese archipelago consists of three islands lying in the middle of the Mediterranean, 93km (57mi) south of Sicily and 350km (217mi) north of Libya. Malta, the largest, is shaped like a bottle of port, and is indented by many bays and harbours. Aside from a few low ridges and outcrops, Malta is pretty flat and composed mainly of limestone. Gozo is greener and hillier than Malta, and its coast has high rugged cliffs.  The islands' soil is generally thin and rocky, yielding very little flora. The main exception is Buskett Gardens, a lush valley of trees and orange groves protected by the imposing Dingli Cliffs on the southwestern coast of Malta.  Malta has an excellent climate, reaching up to 30 C (86 F) in midsummer (July to August) and when the hot sirocco winds blow in from Africa. The lowest average daily high temperature, about 15 C (59 F), occurs during January. Rainfall is heaviest from November to February, though it's low year-round.
