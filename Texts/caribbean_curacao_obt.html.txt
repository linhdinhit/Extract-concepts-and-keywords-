 Off the Beaten Track  This gorgeous sheltered beach on the northwestern tip of Cura ao is the perfect place to get photos of yourself to make your friends jealous. How about one of you sitting contemplatively on dappled rocks, looking out into the turquoise haze of the Caribbean Sea? Or one of you on a deckchair under a palm tree, sipping a cool drink (available from the rustic snack-shack set back from the beach)? And if you can't tear yourself away, don't: there's a low-key resort on the Kadushi Cliffs overlooking the beach. Playa Kalki is a lazy 45 minute drive from Willemstad.
