 When to Go  May/June and September/October are the best months to visit, and though they're very busy periods you can usually find a place away from the crowds. The main tourist season is during the European summer in July and August, when prices rise and accommodation and transport can be tight. The main Indonesian holiday periods are the end of Ramadan, when some resorts are packed to overflowing and prices skyrocket. Another peak time is Christmas, when high school students take off by the busload to visit tourist attractions. Travel in the less developed areas can be difficult during the wet season, from about November to March.     Events   A regional Calendar of Events listing national holidays, festivals particular to the region and other events throughout the year is available from tourist offices in Sumatra. The most important time for Muslims, of course, is Ramadan (Buluan Puasa), the traditional Muslim month of daily fasting, which falls around January to February.  Idul Adha is another important Muslim holiday, commemorating Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac, and it is celebrated around April to May.   Independence Dayis celebrated on 17 August with a national public holiday, parades and special events. Further Muslim holidays are  Muharram, the Islamic New Year in April-May;  Hari Natal, the Prophet Muhammed's birthday in July; and  Isra Miraj Nabi Muhammed, the ascencion of the prophet Mumammed in December.
