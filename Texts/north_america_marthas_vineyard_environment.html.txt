 Environment  Martha's Vineyard, the largest island in New England, lies 5mi (8km) off the coast of Cape Cod. Shaped roughly like a triangle with its southern base the straight shore, Martha's Vineyard is only 9mi (14.5km) wide and 23mi (37km) long, with a total land area of about 100 sq mi (259 sq km) and over 100mi (161km) of tidal shoreline.  The islands and the surrounding Cape are described geologically as 'terminal moraine'. They are what remains of the grit heaved and dumped by glacial motion some 12,000 years ago, leaving a myriad of 'kettle ponds' - the steep-sided freshwater pools that formed when sharp fragments of the glacier were left to melt in place. The island is really lots of sand without any bedrock and the outlines are still subject to constant change and erosion.  The island's modern landscape has changed over the last century as virtually all the trees now represent new growth. Most of the lumber was plundered by the settlers and if the late 19th-century recession hadn't happened there would be little but grasses left growing. The ocean winds, predominantly those out of the southwest, also affect the island. Harbor towns and down-island areas enjoy a canopy of trees, while the more exposed portions of the island consist primarily of grassy sand plains and moors. Watch out for rampantly growing 'poison ivy' across the island.
