 Environment  Shaped like the bit that Van Gogh discarded, Bonaire remains the least populated and least developed of the so-called 'ABC' islands (which it forms with Aruba and Cura ao). The island measures 40km (25mi) from north to south, about 8km (5mi) wide, and lies 72km (45mi) north of Venezuela. It's hilly in the north, flat in the south and dry all over. The highest point is the not quite towering 235m (780ft) Brandaris Hill in Washington-Slagbaai National Park. Bonaire's territory includes dinky Klein Bonaire, a 600ha (1500 acre) islet off the western coast.  Most of your four-legged friends on Bonaire are going to be lizards - they're everywhere, including splattered all over the road. Goats and scrawny donkeys graze the scrub, mostly running wild. The island's only native mammal is the bat - there are a couple dozen distinct subspecies. Over 200 species of birds flap and flutter around Bonaire. You can spot elegant flamingos in the salt flats in the south of the island and in the national park, in the northeast. Parrots and hummingbirds are amongst others to look out for. Four species of sea turtle share Bonaire's sparkling waters with the fish and crustacteans.  Enviro-conscious Bonairean authorities implore visitors to help keep the place spic, span and sporty by leaving dive sites as found, minimizing the quantity of disposable packaging brought and bought, and taking dead batteries off the island on departure. The Bonaire Marine Park was declared in 1979 - it protects all the sea around Bonaire and Klein Bonaire - calculated from the high-tide mark to 60m (200ft) underwater. Proceeds from the US$10 fee levied on your first dive go towards conserving the reef. Klein Bonaire, as yet untouched except by turtles who nest there and picnickers who munch there, has been approached by developers; there's a campaign to have it declared a sanctuary.
