 Activities  If walking up and down Macau's hilly cobbled streets isn't enough to get your blood pumping, there are jogging tracks around the Guia Lighthouse, along Avenida da Republica and around the tip of the peninsula. The Guia Lighthouse is also the venue for t'ai chi. There's an 8km (5mi) hiking trail in the hills of Coloane, plus the island has recreation facilities and a couple of decent swimming beaches. The most popular activity is of course gambling, with nine 24-hour casinos and a choice of baccarat, blackjack, keno and one-arm bandits. You can literally go to the dogs by betting on the greyhounds at the Canidrome or on the horses at Taipa's Hippodrome. And if there's any money left over, spend it shopping for treasures in Macau's alleys and markets - there's everything from specialist cigarettes and herbal remedies to pawned Gucci shirts, plus the usual duty-free goods.
