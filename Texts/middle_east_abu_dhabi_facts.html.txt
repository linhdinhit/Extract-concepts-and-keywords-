 When to Go  Visiting in high summer (July and August) is simply a bad idea - however, if you enjoy temperatures of 48 C (118 F) you will be treated to heavily discounted hotel rates. Many hotels also offer up to 50% off their normal rates during Ramadan.  From May to September, daytime temperatures are in the low to mid-40 C (104-113 F) range. In the winter months, temperatures average in the low to mid-20 C (68-77 F) range. It can get very windy during these months.     Events  These specific event dates apply to the years 2001 and 2002. The main Islamic holidays are Ramadan (November), Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, Eid al-Adha (February), which marks the pilgrimage to Mecca, and the Prophet's Birthday (May or June).  The UAE also observes New Year's Day, Lailat al-Mi'raj (Ascension of the Prophet) and National Day in (2 December). In Abu Dhabi, August 6th is a holiday marking the accession of Sheikh Zayed.  The UAE Desert Challenge road rally is a dusty, rollicking affair that takes place in November. The race starts and finishes in Dubai, but revs through Abu Dhabi territory as well. More in the spirit of most visitors is a shopping festival in early March.
