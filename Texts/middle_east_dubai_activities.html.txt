 Activities  Although many beaches are the private domains of various five-star hotels, for a (stiff) fee, you can spend the day lounging on the sand and swimming in the Gulf's clear water with the beautiful people. There are also public beaches, but single women may find the male attention a bit much. Plenty of water sports, including Jet-Skiing, water-skiing, scuba diving, snorkeling and deep-sea fishing are offered by dozens of operators.  It costs a fortune to maintain the greens, but golfing is a huge draw and Dubai has most of the Arabian Peninsula's courses. If it's too hot to don the requisite collared shirt and slacks, consider a visit to the slides at Wild Wadi Waterpark or one of the city's two indoor ice skating rinks. Dozens of health clubs make working out a breeze.  If a trip inland is more your speed, a desert safari, complete with camels, a barbecue dinner and even a belly dancer for entertainment may be just the thing. Sand-skiing involves a single deck and an arduous climb up the tallest dune you can find. Go-karting and 4WD desert driving are the fastest ways to find fun in the sun.  The Dubai Explorer or What's On have more comprehensive listings of the the city's activities and organisations.
