 Activities  Traffic and its attendant fumes are a serious disincentive to exercise-minded New Yorkers. However, if outdoor activity is your thing, there are a few options. The Chelsea Piers Complex on the Hudson River has interpretations of most sports, with a driving range, an indoor skating rink, a running track, swimming pool, workout center, beach volleyball (minus the ocean) and rock climbing. If you prefer to actually go somewhere when you're running, Central Park's six-mile roadway loops around the park and is closed to cars between 10am and 3pm weekdays and all weekend. The Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir has a soft 1.5 mile (2.5km) running track and there's a runner's pathway along the Hudson from 23rd St to Battery Park City.  You can rent bikes all over the city, but Central Park is the only traffic-free place to ride them. In-line skating is extremely popular, with Central Park (again) being the most popular place to show off your prowess. Although it's possible to fish in the Hudson, and although many people pull in a striped bass or two here, you'd have to be a float short of a tackle box to eat your catch.
