 Off the Beaten Track  Although a long day trip from Budapest (128km, 80mi), Eger is a beautifully preserved baroque town, with a relaxed, almost Mediterranean feel. It is flanked by two of the Northern Uplands' most splendid ranges of hills and is also home to the celebrated Egri Bikaver (Eger Bull's Blood) wine. Climbing the cobblestone lane to Eger Castle, dating to the 13th century, presents the best overview of the city. There is also a walking tour of the city which starts at Eger Cathedral (1836) in the town centre. The wine cellars of the seductively named Valley of the Beautiful Women are not to be missed. Southwest of the town centre and down into the valley are dozens of cellars - some with musicians and outside tables, others locked up to party elsewhere. This is the place to sample Bull's Blood. Everybody loves Eger, perhaps it's the wine. There are up to five direct trains a day (two hours) from Budapest's Keleti station and also very good bus services running every hour or so to/from Nepstadion via route No 3.
