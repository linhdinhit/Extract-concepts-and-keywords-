 Off the Beaten Track  This broad, flat, fertile valley, surrounded by the Tian Shan to the north and the Pamir Alay range to the south, is the heartland of Uzbekistan, the most densely settled part of Central Asia and the focus of the region's silk production. The Russians were quick to turn vast areas of the valley to cotton production and transform its ancient trading towns into ugly industrial zones, so for the visitor its main assets are a conservative, proud and hospitable people, the kaleidoscopic bazaar at Marghlan and the proximity of the mountains. Transport hubs in the valley include Kokand, Ferghana and Marghilan. Daily flights connect Tashkent to Ferghana, buses travel to Kokand and trains to Marghilan.
