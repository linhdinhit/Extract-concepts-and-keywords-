 Activities  With big thanks to the barrier reef, Cozumel, replete with tropical fish, coral and undersea flora, has some of the best scuba diving in the Yucat n. Schools of dive operators await to sink you to the drop-dead-gorgeous depths below. The 100 or so high-quality sites include Palancar Reef, Santa Rosa and Punta Sur. Aficionados of snorkeling are also sure to smile a lot here; the most idyllic places to don your snorkeling apparatus are reached by boat. Half-day tours cost a pretty penny but are worth it, though you can save the fare by walking into the gentle surf at Playa La Ceiba, Bah a Chankanaab, Playa San Francisco and elsewhere.  In Cozumel's bath-temperature waters, swimming is always a pleasure. There are many great spots to practice that stroke, though be wary of some of the east-coast beaches where strong currents might spoil your plans. Various tour agents offer a chance to get back to the island's roots with deep-sea fishing trips. To get a little higher, you might want to give parasailing a go.
