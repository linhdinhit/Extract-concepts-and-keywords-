 Activities  The wide Detroit River provides a good berth for summertime sailing and boating - dodging the constant freighters transporting stuff from the north is a sport in itself. Belle Isle, the pretty Detroit River island just a stone's throw from downtown, has a 5 mile (8km) road around its circumference that's good for running and cycling. Georgian Bay, which bulges out of the northeastern corner of Lake Huron, about a half day's drive from Detroit, has some incredible scuba diving. Hundreds of ships have been lost on its shoals over the decades. Lake Michigan's Manitou Passage is another good diving spot.
