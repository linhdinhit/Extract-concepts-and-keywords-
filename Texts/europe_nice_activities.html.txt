 Activities  The landscape of the Alpes-Maritime area is perfect for a variety of activities, including hiking, mountain biking and horse riding in the nearby Parc National du Mercantour. For downhill skiing, the closest resort is Greolieres (1400-1800m/4600-5900ft), which is 60km(37mi) away. There's a leisure park at Castel Des Deux Rois to keep the kids amused, and parts of Nice's 7.5km(4.5mi) of pebbly beach have areas reserved for children. Water sports facilities are widely available throughout the area, including water-skiing, jet-skiing, sailboarding and diving. Boat excursions head off to the les de Lerins, Monaco and San Remo. And of course the promenade des Anglais is the place for rollerblading; blades can be hired on the promenade itself or near the train station.
