 Off the Beaten Track  If you're exceptionally adventurous and want to see a ghost town in the making, head east to the isolated ancient town of Tichit, 865km (520mi) due east of the capital. It lies in the centre of a massive fault of rock streching almost to the Malian border. As a supply town it once boasted over 5000 people, but you'd be lucky to find 500 now. Visitors are rewarded with beautiful, decorative mosques - the most ornate in Mauritania. On the way, the landscape is a deadly mix of twisted shrubs, bleached bones, bare trees and - yes - sand. Never travel to Tichit without a guide, and check in with the police when you arrive. Believe us, they'll be surprised to see you.
