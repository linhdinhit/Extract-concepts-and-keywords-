 Activities  Apart from the many activities with a Mayan connection, Guatemala offers great hiking and climbing in the highlands and the volcanoes surrounding Lago de Atitl n and Antigua. Contact your embassy or consulate in Guatemala City for information on the current safety of particular areas before setting out. Keep an eye out for the elusive national bird, the quetzal, when birdwatching around Tikal National Park or Lago de Atitl n. Spanish language courses are a popular feature of Antigua and Quetzaltenango.
