 Off the Beaten Track  York boasted 41 churches before Henry VIII gave monasteries the flick back in 1535. Of these, an unexpected 20 still survive, many with their exquisite stained-glass windows intact and all offering the travel-weary a place to rest their tired Birkenstocks. The finest is All Saints, North St, with its most unusual stained-glass depiction of a spectacle-wearing churchgoer from the 15th century. The church is said to be haunted, as is Holy Trinity, Goodramgate, tucked away in a churchyard that's popular with lunch-munching shopworkers. All Saints Pavement is on a busy intersection, but step inside and there's fine stained glass and a lantern tower. St Denys, Walmgate, has York's oldest stained glass and a Norman porch.
