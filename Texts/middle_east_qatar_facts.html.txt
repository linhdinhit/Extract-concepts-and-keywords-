The big one is Ramadan, a month when everyone fasts between sunrise and sunset to conform to the fourth pillar of Islam. In 1998 and 1999, Ramadan is in December. Ramadan ends with a huge feast, Eid al-Fitr, during which everyone prays together, visits friends, gives presents and stuffs themselves silly. Eid al-Adha, held around March, is the other big feast of the year, marking the time when Muslims should make the hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca. Qatar's only non-religious holiday is National Day, on 3 September.
