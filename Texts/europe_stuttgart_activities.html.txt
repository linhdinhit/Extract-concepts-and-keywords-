 Activities  While Stuttgart's cultural attractions are certainly worth seeing, make sure to take advantage of all the outdoor activities this green city has to offer. Go wine tasting in some of the more than 500 local vineyards. Soak in a mineral spring, or swim in one of many open-air pools. Rent a bicycle and cruise along the Neckar - the ride to nearby Max-Eyth-See is a favorite with young Stuttgarters. Climb a staircase to hillside parks for spectacular views of the city. After a day of hiking and biking, relax with a Dinkel Acker in a beer garden, or check out one of the free operas or classical concerts in the Schillerplatz. Another attractive option: take a boat ride on the river for a sightseeing day trip or a romantic evening of dancing on deck.
