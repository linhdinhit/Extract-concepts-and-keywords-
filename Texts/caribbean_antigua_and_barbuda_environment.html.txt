 Environment  Lying near the northeastern corner of the Caribbean, Antigua is about 300mi (480km) east of Puerto Rico. Barbuda, its sister island, is 25mi (40km) north of Antigua. Antigua is a shapeless blob, its shore indented with many bays. The southwestern corner is the hilliest part of the island, rising to 1320ft (400m) at Boggy Peak, Antigua's highest point. The rest of the island is mostly undulating plains and scrubland. Barbuda is a low-lying coral island; its highest point is a mere 145ft (45m). The west side of the island encompasses the expansive Codrington Lagoon. The country's boundaries also include Redonda, an uninhabited rocky islet, less than 1 sq mi in size, lying 25mi (40km) southwest of Antigua.  As a consequence of colonial-era deforestation, most of Antigua's vegetation is dry-land scrub. The area supports the fourth-largest mangrove system in the Lesser Antilles.  The island's marshes and salt ponds attract stilts, egrets, ducks and pelicans, while hummingbirds hang about the gardens. Guiana Island, off the northeastern coast of Antigua, has one of the country's last remaining tracts of forest and is the sole habitat for the tropical mockingbird. Guiana also supports Antigua's largest colony of nesting seabirds, including tropicbirds, roseate terns, brown noddies and endangered whistling ducks. Barbuda's Codrington Lagoon has the largest frigate-bird colony in the Lesser Antilles. One of the world's rarest snakes, the Antiguan racer, is found on nearby Great Bird Island.
