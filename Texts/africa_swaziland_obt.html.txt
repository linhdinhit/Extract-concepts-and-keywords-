 Off the Beaten Track  Siteki is on the road to nowhere, but the town offers a cool respite in the Lebombo Mountains from the plains below. The former haunt of highwaymen and frontier troops, the town takes its name from Mbandzeni, great-grandfather of the present king, who gave his troops permission to marry here. The town's name means 'marrying place'. Siteki is renowned for its Inyanga and Sangoma School, a government school to train healers and diviners. It's a fascinating mix of botany, spiritualism and natural science, and you can visit the school if you arrange it in advance through Swazi Tourism in Mbabane. Not far from Siteki is the Muti-Muti Nature Reserve used extensively by practitioners at the Inyanga and Sangoma School for the variety of herbs used in their work ( muti means roughly 'magic' and 'folk medicine' in southern Africa). You can reach Siteki via a good paved road east from Manzini, a trip of about 60km (37mi) by car or bus.
