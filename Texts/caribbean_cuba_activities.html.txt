 Activities  There are terrific hiking and trekking possibilities on the Cuban island. Marked walking trails, maps and professional guides are almost nonexistent but local residents will usually guide you for just a few dollars.   Horseback riding is also popular among visitors, and special tourist ranches have been established at Baconao and Trinidad. The northeasterly tradewinds bring good swells between December and April, but surfers will have to bring their own boards as none are locally available for rent. Cuba is endowed with wonderful areas for scuba diving and snorkelling, and the 30-odd dive centers across the country offer organized dives, courses and equipment for hire. Deep-sea fishing is also popular in Cuba's waters.
