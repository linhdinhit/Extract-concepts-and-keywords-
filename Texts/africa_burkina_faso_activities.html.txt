 Activities  The southwest of Burkina Faso, around Banfora, offers a number of hiking opportunities, particularly around the rock formations and waterfalls of Sindou. It's also a great area for motor bike, mobylette or bicycle tours (weather permitting). The area around the Karfiguela waterfalls is suitable for camping. Outdoor accommodation makes a nice change and the scenery is spectacular, particularly in the rainy season.
