 Off the Beaten Track  Virtually untapped by tourism, Long Island is the most scenic in The Bahamas. Atlantic rollers crash against the cliffs on the windward coast. Shallow bays indent the western shore. At the northern tip of the island is Cape Santa Maria, where the western shore is one long white-sand beach shelving into turquoise shallows. Snorkeling is especially good at the reef gardens on the cape's southern end. The island's main base is Stella Maris, the setting for acclaimed scuba diving and sport fishing. The town is essentially an upscale residential community on the northeastern coast, though there are good beaches and tidepools. There's a spectacular beach at McKann's Bay on the western coast, where tall dunes back a wide crescent of sand indented with bird-filled lagoons.  In the center of the island is the commercial hub of Salt Pond, where the biggest excitement is the arrival of the mail boat. Aside from the beautiful St Joseph's Anglican Church, there are few sights here, but you can hike trails through tall dunes overlooking the waters on both sides of the islands. Fifteen miles (24km) south of Salt Pond is Deadman's Cay, where history buffs can poke around the ruins of an old plantation. Immediately south of town are Cartwright's Caves, once used by Lucayan Indians and now home to a colony of bats. Just south of Deadman's Cay is the hamlet of Petty's, home of the famous Wild Tamarind Pottery Studio, where you can browse or buy fine ceramics.
