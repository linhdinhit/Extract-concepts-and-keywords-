 Off the Beaten Track  On 24 June 1981, six teenagers in this dirt-poor mountain village between Citluk and Ljubuski, just south-west of Mostar, saw a miraculous apparition of the Virgin Mary, and Medugorje's instant economic boom began. A decade later, Medugorje was awash with tour buses, duty-free shops, souvenir stands, car-rental offices, travel agencies, restaurants, shiny Mercedes taxis and traffic jams. 'Religious tourism' developed as if it were a beach resort. Yes, miracles do still happen.   The civil war pared the number of pilgrims to a minimum, but the tourist facilities remain intact and the crowds are returning with renewed fervour. Check the Church of St James for the daily programme of masses, meetings, blessings and prayers. If you're in it for the full nine yards, apparitions have traditionally appeared on Monday and Friday on the side of Podbrdo, the Hill of Apparitions, about an hour's walk from St James.
