 Attractions  Imagine a museum that allows you to tour most of Norway in just one day. Picture wandering the streets of old Norway and getting a feel of what life was like hundreds of years ago. One of Oslo's biggest drawcards, the Norwegian Folk Museum, allows you to do just that. This fascinating open-air museum contains around 150 buildings from different regions, mostly dating from the 17th and 18th centuries, including one of Norway's oldest structures, the Gol Stave Church, built early in the 13th century in Gol and moved to its present location in 1885. You'll wander past old banks, pharmacies, post offices, barns and farmhouses and see folk dancing and weaving and people dressed in festive costumes. The Old Town section reproduces an early 20th century town and contains a petrol station and a general store, and the first thing you'll come across as you step through the main entrance is a huge display of old toys, costumes, tools and appliances from around the country. The museum is on the Bygdøy peninsula, a 10-minute ferry trip from central Oslo.
