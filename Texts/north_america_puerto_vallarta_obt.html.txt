 Off the Beaten Track  The small, relaxed beachside village of Sayulita, 35km (22mi) north of Puntas Arenas and just around the rocky claw of Punta (Point) Villeta from Bah a de Banderas, is the place sought out by sand-dwellers and surfers once the exuberant gloss of resort life has rubbed a bit thin. An unobtrusive town on a magnificent shade-soaked beach backed by iconic coconut palms, Sayulita balances out its dearth of city ruckus with a laidback feel and an oversupply of outdoor activities.  Several places in the town centre rent out bicycles and surfboards, and organise regional expeditions to indulge in diving, snorkelling, horse riding and kayaking. You can also go trekking in the authentically exotic jungle that lies along the coast and inland towards Tepic, the capital of Nayarit state in which Sayulita lies. Sayulita is an hour's bus ride from Puerto Vallarta and there are up to 10 services a day between the two destinations.
