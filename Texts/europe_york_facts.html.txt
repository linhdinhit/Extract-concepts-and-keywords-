 When to Go  A visit to York is best rewarded in April-June and September-October. Do what you can to avoid July-August, as the city deteriorates into a shambles of demented tourism in the high summer months. November-February are cold, dark and grim - and bring your brolly and woollies any time of year.     Events  York celebrates a handful of typically idiosyncratic events. February's Jorvik Viking Festival harks back to the city's Danish past, complete with a longships regatta, torchlit procession, boat burning and fireworks. The annual Early Music Festival hits town in June. York is transformed into the Ascot of the north for the three-day Ebor Meeting in August, held at Knavesmire on the edge of town. Every four years the city hosts the medieval York Cycle of Mystery Plays (coming round again in 2002). Christmas is heralded with the St Nicholas Fayre, 23-26 November, with traditional food, antique fairs and street theatre.
