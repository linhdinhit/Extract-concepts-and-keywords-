 Environment  Shaped a bit like an upside-down Afghan hound, Mozambique stretches for 2500km (1550mi) on the south-eastern coast of Africa, bordered by Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the north-west, Zimbabwe to the west, and South Africa and Swaziland to the south-west. The island of Madagascar lies directly east, 400km (250mi) across the Mozambique Channel.  The coastal plain, as wide as 200km (125mi) in the south, rises to mountains and plateaux in the north and west. Two of Southern Africa's longest rivers, the Zambezi and the Limpopo, flow through the country. Other major rivers are the Save and the Rovuma (which forms the northern border with Tanzania). Massive Lake Malawi (also called Lake Nyasa) forms part of the border with Malawi.  As you go westward, the land changes abruptly from a narrow, palm-studded strip of beach along the coast to a broad belt of savannah and woodland, then forested mountains. Trees include hardwoods, acacia and papaya. Fauna include the rare, endangered black rhinoceros.  There are many regional variations in Mozambique, but generally the dry season runs from April to September, when the average daily high tops out at 27 C (80 F) on the coast, cooler inland. The rainy season lasts most of the rest of the year, when the average daily high hits 31 C (88 F).
