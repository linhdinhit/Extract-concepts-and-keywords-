 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: All foreign nationals bar those from Germany and the USA need a visa to visit Rwanda. A visa arranged in advance of your visit will require US$50 and two passport photos, and will allow you to stay for up to a month; visas of the double or multiple-entry variety are recommended to give you flexibility when it comes to visiting neighbouring countries. But keep in mind that unless you enjoy the prospect of being tied up in red tape and beaten senseless with a manilla folder, it's generally best to organise the visa after you've arrived in East Africa. At the Rwandan border, 15-day visas are issued in a matter of minutes for US$35. Visa extensions of up to 90 days are available at the Ministry of the Interior near Kigali within a day or two of applying (though sometimes much longer) for between US$10-40 depending on the length of the extension.Health risks: Malaria in low-lying regions, cholera, hepatitis, typhoid, HIV, Rift Valley Fever, yellow fever and drinking too muchkonyagi.Time: GMT/UTC + 2 hours.Electricity: 220V ACWeights & measures: Metric When to Go  Unless you literally want to soak up the atmosphere, the only time that is not ideal for visiting Rwanda is when the long rains descend from mid-March to mid-May.
