 Environment  With an area about the size of Germany, squarish C te d'Ivoire is bordered on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Liberia and Guinea, to the north by Mali and Burkina Faso, and on the east by Ghana. Except for the western hill country around Man, C te d'Ivoire is mostly flat. The coastal area is notable for an inland lagoon that starts at the Ghanaian border and stretches 300km (190mi) along the entire eastern half of the coast.  In the south is Yamoussoukro, the country's capital, and the cocoa and coffee farms that grow C te d'Ivoire's major export crops. Around them are remnants of the rainforests that once covered the entire southern area; the land becomes savannah farther north. The expansion of agricultural lands poses a major threat to the country's diverse flora and fauna. Rainforests are being cut down at the highest rate in the world; the only remaining virgin forest is in the 3600 sq km (1400 sq mi) Ta National Park in the far south-western corner of C te d'Ivoire. The timber industry is the main culprit; hardwood exports are on a level with those of Brazil, a country 20 times larger.  C te d'Ivoire is humid and tropical along the coast and semi-arid in the north, with three distinct seasons. The country is warm and dry from November to March; hot and dry from March through May; and hot and wet from June through October; July is wettest of all. From early December to February, the harmattan winds blow sand south from the Sahara, reducing visibility in the northern mountain regions.
