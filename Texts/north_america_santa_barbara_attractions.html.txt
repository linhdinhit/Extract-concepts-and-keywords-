 Attractions  Called the 'Queen of the Missions', Mission Santa Barbara sits high on a perch overlooking the downtown area. Established on 4 December, 1786 (the Feast Day of St Barbara), the mission still functions today as a Franciscan friary as well as a parish church and museum. Three adobe structures preceded the existing stone version, which dates from 1820; its main facade has elegant neoclassical-style columns. Inside you'll see Chumash Native American Indian wall decorations and beyond, peaceful courtyard gardens. Behind the church is an extensive cemetery, with over 4000 Chumash graves and elaborate mausoleums of early California settlers.
