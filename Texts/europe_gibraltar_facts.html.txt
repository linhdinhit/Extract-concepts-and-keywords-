 When to Go  You might want to bear in mind that July and August can be hot, with average highs around 27.5 C (82 F), but otherwise, there's no wrong time to visit Gibraltar. April and October can be especially lovely: the weather is mild and there's no tourist crush to worry about. The coldest month is January with average temperatures between 11 C (52 F) and 16 C (61 F).  January to early June is the time to view northbound migrations of raptors and storks, late July to early November is when the flocks are southbound.     Events  Gibraltar takes holidays at Easter, two days at Christmas and one for New Year. There's also Commonwealth Day on 12 March, the Queen's Birthday in mid-June and Gibraltar National Day on 10 September. Gibraltar's modest program of annual events includes a flower show in April, an arts and sporting festival which runs through most of May and an annual fair which straddles National Day in September. There's also a drama festival in early December. The Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society hosts 'rambles' on the last Sunday of each month, focusing on various natural features of the territory.
