 When to Go  Geneva is a popular base for the Alps, making it a destination year round for sightseeing, skiing and hiking. At any time of year the climatic conditions can vary extremely in Alpine regions, with mid-August to late October providing the most settled weather. The best of the weather is between June and September - but this is also the high season in the high country, when the sights and lodgings will be packed with European vacationers, hikers and backpackers in bulk. It's also the wettest time of year. The shoulder season offers a better deal with prices and crowds, and skiing conditions are usually still very good.     Events  Geneva's best-known festival is the celebration of l'escalade on 11 December, involving the wild consumption of chocolate and marzipan. It marks the occasion in 1602 when one of the invading Duke of Savoy's soldiers was thwarted by an unhappy housewife who poured her boiling cauldron of vegetable soup over him and then smashed it over his head. Several times. In Genevan homes the vegetable soup has been replaced by Switzerland's famous sweet (and patented) cocoa perfection. In the town there are torch-lit processions in historic costume and a huge bonfire in the cathedral square. And more chocolate.  The F tes de Geneve spans two weekends in August with parades, open-air concerts and fireworks, while the Bol d'Or in mid-June sees Lake Geneva come alive with the bobbing white sails of some 600 yachts racing to the far end of the lake and back.
