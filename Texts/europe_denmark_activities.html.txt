 Activities  Denmark prides itself on being a bicycle-friendly country. The country is crisscrossed with thousands of kilometers of established cycling routes, including 10 long-distance ones. The shortest of the stamina-testers runs for 100km around the perimeter of Bornholm, while the longest runs along the west coast of Jutland some 500km from the German border to Skagen. The most popular cycling tour in the Copenhagen area is the 12-kilometre ride north to Dyrehaven, much of it skirting the Øresund coast, but also darting down pleasant woodland trails.  All around the country, from the southern shores of Bornholm to the northernmost tip of Jutland, there are numerous swimming opportunities along sandy strands. Denmark also has some excellent spots for windsurfing (called 'surfing' in Danish), varying from the open sea, favoured by pros, to inland fjords and sheltered coastal inlets where calm waters are ideal for beginners. With over 7300km of coastline and hundreds of islands, Denmark offers excellent yachting possibilities. There are lots of calm-water fjords and protected seas, such as Smålandshavet (the area nestled between Zealand and Lolland), as well as the island-dotted waters south of Funen. Denmark abounds in streams and lakes, many of which are stocked with pike, perch and trout. The saltwater fishing possibilities are nearly endless; the most common saltwater fish are cod, mackerel, plaice and sea trout.
