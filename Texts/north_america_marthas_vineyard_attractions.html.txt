 Attractions  To the extent that the island has a commercial center, Vineyard Haven is it - a harbor town where the ferries come and go year-round and with a permanent community making it the place to stay in the off-season. Although the most mellow of the islands' three principal towns it's also the most 'real'. Vineyard Haven was incorporated in 1671, although virtually every building in the heart town burned to the ground in the great fire of 1883. The town's backstreets, especially William St, are lined with sturdy sea captains' homes. Today the town still draws its energy from the waterfront. You'll see schooners and sloops sharing the harbor with barges, ferries and the second largest collection of traditionally built wooden sailboats to be found anywhere in the country, (only Camden, Maine is thought to have more). For sightseeing junkies there are a couple of attractions worth seeing. Built in 1817, the West Chop Lighthouse was the island's last manned light and is at the northern end of town. Chicama Vineyard, just outside of town, does a fairly credible job of making wine and it seems only right to sample a drop from a working vineyard while on the Vineyard.
