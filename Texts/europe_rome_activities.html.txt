 Activities  Rome's activities (apart from the mandatory sight-seeing) usually involve nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking and listening to good music. Conceivably you could work up a sweat running up and down the Spanish Steps; it's just that everyone will get excited thinking you're chasing a pickpocket. If you're with kids or just a child at heart, there are pony rides and Sunday Punch & Judy shows on Gianicolo Hill, a short walk southeast of the Holy City. If you're sore from foot-slogging from one monument to the next, reward yourself by escaping to the relaxing thermal springs mentioned in Dante's Divine Comedy. They're near Viterbo, 90km (55mi) north of Rome.  Otherwise, there are a few serious fitness options. You can swim, either at the beaches on the Lazio coast, or if you can't be bothered going that far, at a hotel pool, or at a stretch, one of the public swimming pools - but these can be hard to get to, are expensive, have varying opening hours and some even require a doctor's certificate before you can swim. You can rent bicycles and cycle near the Porta Pinciana in Villa Borghese. Villa Doria Pamphili, 2km (1mi) south of the Vatican, is the largest park in Rome and a lovely spot for a jog or gentle stroll. Horse riding is available at the exclusive Il Galoppatoio equestrian club in Villa Borghese, but exclusivity costs money, lots of it.
