 Off the Beaten Track  Lexington is a repository of the kind of American History that comes in capital letters and reverent tones. On 17 April 1775, Paul Revere and two companions rode from Boston to Lexington in the predawn hours to warn the colonial militia - the Minutemen - of the impending approach of British troops. What followed was the first battle of the Revolutionary War, which took place on Lexington Green (now called Battle Green). This leafy, placid town has a number of historic houses and taverns, such as the 1695 Munroe Tavern and the 1689 Hancock-Clarke House, where John Hancock and Samuel Adams hid out from the Red Coats. Lexington is about 18 miles (29km) northwest of downtown Boston and is accessible by a combination of the subway and public bus.
