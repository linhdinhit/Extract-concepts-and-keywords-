 Environment  Southern Michigan is dominated by urban centers. Michigan's heartland is a 20-county region that lies at the center of the Lower Peninsula, south of US 10 and away from the Great Lakes shore lines. It includes urban areas, farm fields and suburbs connected by a network or interstates (I-94, I-96, I-69 and I-196) and US highways. On your way north don't necessarily forsake these cities; some of them are attractive and have their own charm.  Detroit and southeastern Michigan are regions of vivid contrasts. While some parts of Detroit are depressing displays of urban blight, suburbs such as Birmingham and West Bloomfield make Oakland County, just north of Detroit, one of the richest counties in the United States.
