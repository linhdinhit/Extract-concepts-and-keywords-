 Attractions  From its founding in 1706 until the arrival of the railroad in 1880, Old Town was the spiritual, social and geographical center of Albuquerque. Built around a central plaza, the area is now essentially a four block historical and architectural museum, atmospheric but punctuated with a glut of art galleries and souvenir shops. The most famous building is San Felipe de Neri Church, on the plaza's northern side. Built in 1706, the church has undergone several renovations and is now much changed from its original modest adobe form, but retains its humble interior. Other visitor must-see's are the Albuquerque Museum of Art, History and Science, just northeast of the plaza, and, on the northeastern fringe of Old Town, the New Mexico Museum of Natural History.
