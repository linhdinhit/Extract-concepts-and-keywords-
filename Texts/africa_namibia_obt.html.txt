 Off the Beaten Track  The Central Plateau is the prize of colonialism. This is prime agricultural land and the German and Afrikaner settlers and their families who have inherited this area run sheep and cattle on vast, wide-open rural properties, or grow citrus fruit and market vegetables. Towns are widely spaced, and Namibia's main arterial north-south route, the B1, cuts through the region. This road is so good that most passers-by pass by way too fast to appreciate the surrounds.  The small town of Rehoboth was established as a Rhenish mission station in 1844, but was abandoned 20 years later only to be revived in the 1870s by the Basters (literally 'bastards'), an ethnic group of mixed Khoi-Khoi/Afrikaner origin who are very proud of their history and name (rather than considering it offensive, the people are proud of their name and their heritage). The Reho Spa complex is built around a thermal spring, and there's a fine museum housed in the 1903 residence of the first postmaster.   Brukkaros is a 2km (1.2mi) wide volcanic crater which can be seen from the B1 between Mareintal and Keetmanshoop. From the car park there's a path that leads to the crater's southern rim, a half-hour's walk away, and from there you can enter the crater and proceed to an abandoned research station. Camping is permitted anywhere in the crater and Brukkaros's famous clear night skies make this an unforgettable experience.  The central crossroads in southern Namibia is Keetmanshoop, a town of 15,000 people and the centre of the regional wool industry. Keetmanshoop has more petrol stations per capita than any other place in Namibia. It was originally a settlement for the Nama people, and the Rhenish Mission Society founded a town there in 1866. Here too are many fine colonial-era buildings, and  Keetmanshoop Museum is well worth exploring. Tours are available from the town to areas of interest in southern Namibia, including the mighty Fish River Canyon and Lüderitz.
