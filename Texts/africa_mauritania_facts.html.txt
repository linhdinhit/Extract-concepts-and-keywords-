The most tolerable weather occurs between November and February, when it's hot and sunny during the day, but cooling off in the evenings with southerlies blowing in from the desert. From June to October it's very hot all the time, but bearable for brief visits. Never go between March and May unless a constant blast of sand and hot wind is high on your list of priorities.     Events  Aside from Muslim celebrations, and in particular the feasting of Tabaski (Eid-al-Kabir), Mauritania is not the best destination if you're looking for flamboyant, joyous displays of culture. Independence is marked on 28 November.
