 Activities  Andorra has the finest inexpensive skiing and snowboarding in the Pyrenees. Pas de la Casa-Grau Roig and Soldeu-El Tarter are the best resorts based on size, elevation and number of lifts, but they are also more expensive than Andorra's smaller ones. The ski season usually lasts from December to March, depending on snow conditions. Major Andorran resorts use snow-making machines on favoured runs.  The tranquillity of Andorra's beautiful, relatively unspoiled back country makes for some great hiking. The north-westerly parish of Ordino has especially good trails. The GR11 trail, which traverses the Pyrenees from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, passes through the southern part of Andorra. Hikers can sleep for free in the numerous refugis (shelters) along the major trails.   Mountain bikes can be rented at the larger ski areas during the dry months, and hang-gliders are popular at the Soldeu-El Tarter ski area in Canillo parish.
