 Activities   Surfing and swimming at the city's beaches are favoured activities; but Rottnest Island has good diving and fishing, and the picturesque Avon River is a popular canoeing spot. You can also get out on the ocean by renting a catamaran at the South Perth foreshore, or asking around Perth's yachting clubs for volunteer spots on racing yachts.  There are a number of activities that bring you into contact with marine mammals in and around Perth, including watching for humpback whales returning to Antarctic waters after wintering in the ocean off north-western Australia. The Darling Ranges are famous for their geological diversity and around Perth you can explore evidence of the break up of Gondwanaland (formerly one of two ancient supercontinents).
