 Attractions  This ramshackle, colorful Caribbean city was Belize's former capital and is the country's only settlement of any size. The tropical storms which periodically razed the town in the 19th and early 20th centuries still arrive to do damage to its aging wooden buildings, but they also flush out the open drainage canals, redolent with pollution, which crisscross the city. When there's no storm, Belize City bustles, steams and swelters. Few people come to Belize City for a holiday or to see the sights but it's the transport and commercial hub of the country, so travelers are likely to spend some time here. Some travelers report that the city can be quite dangerous, particularly after dark.  The city's commercial center is divided from the more genteel northern neighborhoods by Haulover Creek, a branch of the Belize River. The creek is spanned by the Swing Bridge. Interesting spots south of the bridge include Battlefield Park, which is always busy with vendors, loungers and con men; St John's Cathedral (1847), the oldest and most important Anglican church in Central America; and the Bliss Institute, the city's cultural center. North of the bridge is the wood-framed Paslow Building, housing the city's main post office. Heading south from there is the Image Factory Art Foundation, showcasing work by Belizean artists, and before the tip of the peninsula is the Belize Audubon Society, a good source of info on national parks and wildlife reserves throughout the country.  North Front St, on the north bank of Haulover Creek, has a good selection of budget accommodations. The luxury hotels are located at the end of the north shore peninsula. The main commercial streets are Albert, Regent, King and Orange Sts.
