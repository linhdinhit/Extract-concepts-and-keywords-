 Activities  There's not a whole lot to do in Abu Dhabi. You can window shop along Al-Nasr St for carpets and Arabian souvenirs, though most of these are actually made elsewhere. Locally made crafts are available at the Women's Craft Centre off Airport Rd, south of the centre. There are a couple of good bars and cafes, including one late-nighter which overlooks the water and the city. The Abu Dhabi Golf Club is a few kilometres from the centre of town next to the racecourse. To play the grass course will cost you dearly.
