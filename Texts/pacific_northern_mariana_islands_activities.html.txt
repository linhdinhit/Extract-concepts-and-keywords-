 Activities  There's excellent diving and snorkelling on the islands. On Saipan, the most interesting spot is the Grotto, a natural cavern with waters 50ft (15m) deep and tunnels to the open sea. You can check out WWII wrecks in Tanapag Harbor, caves and garden eels at Obyan Beach and a huge coral head offshore from the Saipan Grand Hotel. Saipan's best snorkelling spot is Managaha Island, Tinian's is Tachogna Beach and Rota's is the Coral Gardens in Sasanhaya Bay. Rota also has good cave, tunnel and wreck dives, including dives to see the Shoun Maru, a Japanese freighter in 90ft (27m) of water.  All three islands have good hiking. On Saipan, the highlight is the Laderan Tangke Trail through the Marpi Commonwealth Forest. There's a fine trail along Kammer and Taga Beaches south of San Jose on Tinian. The views from the hills on either side of Songsong Village on Rota are short hikes.  Other ways to workout include windsurfing, popular off Micro Beach on Saipan; tennis; and a non-aerobic midget- submarine ride in the lagoon between Saipan and Managaha Islands, where you can see wrecks such as a Japanese freighter and an American B-29.
