 Off the Beaten Track  This 750 sq km (465 sq mi) reserve in the foothills of the Talassky Alatau range is one of the highlights of southern Kazakstan and the easiest visited of the country's nature reserves. The scenery ranges from mountain meadows and juniper forests to glaciers and a 4500m (14,760ft) peak. This is an important habitat for the rare snow leopard, though you stand a much better chance of seeing bears, ibex and birds of prey. Guided hikes or horseback trips can be arranged in the village of Zhabaghly, 100km (62mi) west of Zhambyl, which is a good day's train trip from Almaty.
