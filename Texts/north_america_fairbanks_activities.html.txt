 Activities  Winter sports enthusiasts are overwhelmed for choice in Fairbanks. There are plenty of well-kept cross-country skiing trails, and some downhill and snowboarding options not too far away. Snowshoeing has become a popular pursuit in its own right, as well as a way to get around. Snowmachines are also both a transportation method and a sporting activity. Even walking a dog takes on a particular Interior slant, with locals adding cross-country skis to the mix, and calling it skijoring. Of course, dog mushing is huge, as is ice fishing. There is also ample opportunity to rent equipment for the more prosaic ice skating and ice hockey.   Fishing is popular in winter (with an ice auger and some patience) and during the warmer months (with strong insect repellent). Note, you are more likely to catch an Arctic grayling than a salmon in these parts. Fairbanks is close to a wide range of canoeing spots, and although there isn't hiking on the urban doorstep, there are some good walks close by, accessible by road. Golf, birdwatching and gold panning are also easy to arrange.
