 Attractions  The view from the gallery atop Carew Tower reveals a bustling city sprinkled with parks and framed by Mount Adams to the northeast and the sensual curves of the Ohio River to the south and east. The art-deco tower stands across the street from Fountain Square, the heart of downtown, where the spray from over a hundred spouts and the shade of dozens of trees cool hot summer afternoon concertgoers. Downtown is peppered with outstanding public art, including a waterfall made of giant books and Jim Dine's Cincinnati Venus.  No place symbolizes the uniquely American synergy of art and commerce like the Procter & Gamble Building, an art-deco gem. The company turned animal fat from the city's slaughterhouses into a soap empire, and by sponsoring a radio show in the 1930s it gave birth to the soap opera.
