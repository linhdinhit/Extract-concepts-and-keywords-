 Attractions  'If Beale Street could talk, married men would take their babes and walk.' That was local blues composer WC Handy's Beale St, circa 1915. In its turn-of-the-century heyday, Beale St was the hub of social, civic and business activity for the city's large African-American community and much of the middle South.  Today, the Disneyfication of the two-block strip of Beale between 2nd and 4th Sts might give some travelers the blues. The rough and tumble barrooms and brothels of yore have been replaced by swanky clubs, restaurants, souvenir shops and neon signs - something of a blues theme park. But it's hard to find fault with the district's safe, comfortable and locally owned and operated nightlife.  Between 2nd and 3rd, musical notes embedded in the concrete mark the Walk of Fame, where some of Memphis' finest musicians are honored. The Beale St Police Museum exhibits such criminalia as the extradition order for James Earl Ray, Martin Luther King Jr's convicted assassin. Schwab's Dry Goods Store, in the family since 1876, is the only remaining original business on Beale St. Schwab's fills three floors with voodoo powders, handcuffs, clerical collars, saucepans and the largest collection of hats in town. Tucked in behind Beale St at 3rd is the Gibson Guitar Plant, where many of the guitar models made famous by local artists are made. Within the plant, the Smithsonian Institution's Rock 'n' Soul Museum examines the social and cultural history that produced the music of the Mississippi Delta.  Between 3rd and 4th Sts, the WC Handy statue overlooks a park named after the composer, where an amphitheater hosts outdoor concerts and New Year's Eve celebrations. Also on the block are the shotgun shack where Handy raised six children, and the Center for the Study of Southern Folklore. The nonprofit center, in an old dry-goods store, has excellent exhibits on art and music, and features live performances.
