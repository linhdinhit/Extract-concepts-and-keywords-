 Off the Beaten Track  The waterfront Auke Bay area, which has a small harbor and campground, is 12mi (19km) northwest of downtown and sits off the Glacier Highway. One of its worthwhile attractions is the Auke Bay Marine Lab, a research facility with a self-guided tour of displays and saltwater tanks. South of the lab on the banks of Auke Lake is the beautiful University of Alaska campus, which displays an interesting Northwest Coast Native art collection in its library. For those preferring culture of the outdoors variety, the islands in its saltwater bay are a great and not too difficult sea-kayaking daytrip. Camping is allowed on the islands, so paddlers can even turn the adventure into an overnight one.
