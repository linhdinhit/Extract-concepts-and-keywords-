 Off the Beaten Track  Just 15km (9mi) north of Madrid is the nearest of several regal escape hatches. This particular palace ended up as Franco's favoured residence, and was also enjoyed by Felipe II in the 1550s. Several hundred tapestries are displayed, some based on cartoons by Goya. In the grounds is an elaborate 'cottage', built for Carlos IV in 1786. Bus No 601 leaves for the palace every 15 minutes from Plaza de la Moncloa in Madrid.
