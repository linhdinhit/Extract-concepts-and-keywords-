 Off the Beaten Track  Samcheok itself, on the northeast coast, hasn't much to recommend it, but the beaches to its south are little gems set between steep cliffs and rocks. Geundeok Beach is off the main road and consequently a bit more isolated than the other beaches - the scenery here is terrific. Yonghwa Beach has a freshwater stream, lots of minbak (rooms in private houses) to stay in, and plenty of seafood to eat. Imwon Beach is only 200m (218 yards) long, but is dramatically set in a cliff-lined cove, with sea caves to investigate. Other, more developed, beach resorts also line this part of the coast. The easiest way to get to all of these beaches is to drive yourself, but irregular local buses also cruise the coast road.
