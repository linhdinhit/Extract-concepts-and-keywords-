The best months to visit are April through June, September and October, when the temperatures are mild and the countryside most colourful. Although July and August have the most festivals, they are also the stickiest (up to 45 C/113 F inland) and most expensive.  While the coastal climate is temperate, inland the winters are fierce and summers scorching. In July and August thermometers can hit a sweltering 36 C (97 F) in Seville and C rdoba. From December to February, top temperatures hover around 16 C (60 F) on the coast and 13 C (55 F) in Granada, where nights are close to freezing. Powerful winds come off the Atlantic, and the east of the region is dryer than the west. The strongest winds pummel Tarifa.     Events  Numerous festivals year-round allow Andalucians to indulge their love of colour, crowds, music, historical plays and general showing off. February and March are carnival time throughout the region (the wildest festivities take place in C diz).  The week leading up to Easter, Semana Santa, sees elaborate celebrations in all the big cities, while the Feria de Abril in April is a week-long party in Seville. In early May the Feria del Caballo (Horse Festival) in Jerez is an equestrian extravaganza, while flamenco is celebrated at the Potage Gitano in Utrera. The Feria de M laga in August is the pinacle of all the summer fairs.  For a spot of history, September's Moros y Cristianos in V lor, Granada, offers a re-enactment of the 1568 Muslim rebellion against the Christians. Jerez de la Frontera's Fiestas de Oto o celebrate the grape harvests with horse races, parades and flamenco dancing from mid-September to mid-October.
