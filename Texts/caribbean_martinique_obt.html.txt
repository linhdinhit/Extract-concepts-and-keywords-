 Off the Beaten Track  One key to the history and culture of Martinique is its rum. When you've processed as much sugar as Martinique has, you end up with a lot of molasses - which tends to turn into rum if you let it sit around long enough.  The best place to start is the Musee du Rhum, just north of Sainte-Marie at the Saint-James Plantation distillery. There are displays of steam-powered sugar-making engines, rum stills and cane-crushing gears. There's also a tasting room where you can sample different rums; if you don't knock back too much you might still be capable of checking out the museum's sugar mill and distillery.  About 5km (3mi) north of Sainte-Marie is Fond Saint-Jacques, the site of an old Dominican monastery and sugar plantation dating from 1660. It was here that a Dominican friar modernized the distilling of rum. The chapel and most of the living quarters are still intact and there are many ruins on the grounds, including those of the mill, distillery basins, boiling house and sugar factory.
