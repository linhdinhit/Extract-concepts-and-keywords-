 Off the Beaten Track  Alofi is only a 15-minute boat ride from Futuna, but the lack of adequate fresh water has kept permanent residents away. Home to a reputed 10,000 pigs, this small island also boasts possibly the best beach Wallis & Futuna has to offer. Think tropical island paradise: white sand, clear water and shady trees. Plenty of locals spend the day at Alofi looking after their pigs and tending their gardens, so you'll be in good company. There is a small church, and if you want to do the Robinson Crusoe thing there are some open fale with solar-powered lighting for overnight stays.
