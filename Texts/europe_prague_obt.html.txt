 Off the Beaten Track  Karlstejn Castle, a 35-minute train ride from Prague's Smichov station, is unquestionably the most photogenic castle in the Prague region. It's also the most visited castle in the Czech Republic - get there early to beat the busloads of tourists angling for that postcard-perfect snap.  The castle was founded by Charles IV as a royal hideaway and a treasury for the crown jewels and various holy relics. Perched on a scenic crag above the Berounka River, its 19th-century remodeling job did nothing to compromise the handsome facade. Top drawcards include the audience hall and imperial bedroom, in the south-facing palace; Marian Tower, with Charles' private quarters and remnants of the lovely frescoes that adorned Charles' private St Catherine Chapel; and the Great Tower, where royal regalia was once kept. The heart of the complex is the lavish Chapel of the Holy Cross, with more golden gilt, semiprecious stones and priceless panels by famed painter Master Theodoric than you can shake a scepter at.  Nearby is the Karlstejn Wax Museum, focusing on merchants from the Middle Ages, and the Museum of Nativity Scenes, featuring the baby Jesus rendered in everything from sheet metal to sugar.
