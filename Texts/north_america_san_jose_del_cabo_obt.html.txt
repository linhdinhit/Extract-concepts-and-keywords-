 Off the Beaten Track  In the cape region's mountainous interior, 15km (9mi) northwest of San Jose del Cabo as the buzzard flies, are the lush, diverse forests of the 1128-sq-km (434-sq-mi) Sierra de la Laguna. It's one of Baja California's four biosphere reserves, a concept initiated in the 1970s by the United Nations Educational, Scientific & Cultural Organization (UNESCO) whereby swathes of naturally significant land in developing countries are fully protected within zonas n cleo (core areas) but locals are allowed to work certain surrounding areas using sustainable methods, hence balancing environmental and economic needs.  Sierra de la Laguna is a rugged, high-altitude wilderness of deciduous, coniferous and palm forests, the hills of which are alive with the sounds of experienced hikers and inexperienced foot-sloggers who have wisely signed up with local guides or organised excursions. There are four main (and unmarked) east-west crossings of the biosphere reserve to choose from: the central Ca n San Bernardo, a five-day haul considered the easiest route for walkers; the northern five to six-day Ca n San Dionisio, which guides you through an ecological wonderland of aspens, pines, palms and cacti; the southern Ca n San Pablo, also a five-day trudge; and the Naranjas Road in Sierra de la Laguna's far south, a treacherously narrow, potholed and arabesque dirt cutting that's frequently targeted by sturdy cars (usually 4WDs) and day-tripping mountain bikers. On-foot crossings of the Reserva de La Bi sfera Sierra de la Laguna are begun from one of a number of foothill villages, all of which you'll need a car to get to unless you're on a tour.
