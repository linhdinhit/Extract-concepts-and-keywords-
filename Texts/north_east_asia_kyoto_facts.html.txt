 When to Go  Weather-wise, spring and autumn are probably the best times to visit Kyoto, although they're also popular times for tourists and school groups. Having said that, although the summers (June-Aug) can be muggy, it's still a nice time to be there. If you're really out to avoid crowds, winter (Dec-Feb) - though very cold - might be just your ticket. Holidays and festivals are celebrated with crowded gusto in Kyoto, so cherry-blossom season in April and Golden Week (late April/early May) are great times to be in the city.     Events  Kyoto's greatest Living Treasures are its vivacious festivals ( matsuri). The city hosts some 500 of these colourful events throughout the year, and almost any visit should provide the chance to catch at least one. Some of the more fascinating festivals include Hatsu Ebisu, 8 to 12 January, where a party is held for Ebisu the patron deity of merchants; Godai Rikison Ninno-e, 23 February, at which participants lift two gigantic rice cakes 150kg (330pds) for men, 90kg (200pds) for women; Gion Matsuri, 17 July, perhaps the most renowned of all Japanese festivals, when over 200,000 people throng the Shijo-Karasuma area, and reaches a climax on the 17th when a Yamaboko-junko parade of over 30 floats is held to the accompaniment of flutes, drums and gongs; and Daimon-ji Gozan Okuribi, 16 August, where enormous fires are lit on five mountains in the form of Chinese characters or other shapes.
