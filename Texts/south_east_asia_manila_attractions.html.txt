 Attractions  The original Chinese settlement on this site was rebuilt as a fort in 1590 by the Spanish, who replaced the wooden buildings with stone. Gradually the area was expanded until it became a walled city containing 15 churches and six monasteries. The walls are 3km (1.8mi) long and 6m (20ft) high, and are about all that remains after WWII finished off what General Douglas MacArthur had started. MacArthur used Intramuros as his base, tearing down old buildings and widening the roads.  In recent years, renovations have begun on some of the remaining buildings. Casa Manila is restored to its former glory, while the church and monastery of San Agustin has remained virtually untouched since the earliest construction at the site. The Manila Cathedral has been damaged or destroyed six times since it was built. You can also see the ruins of Fort Santiago, which is now a pleasant park, and the interesting Rizal Shrine Museum, devoted to the Filipino martyr. Intramuros is just south of the river, in the heart of Manila.
