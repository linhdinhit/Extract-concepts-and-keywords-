 Off the Beaten Track  The centre of Bradford is just 9mi (6km) west of the centre of Leeds, and the outer edges merge so the two cities are effectively united on the ground - although not when it comes to football, or much else, come to that. Leeds sees Bradford as the poor relative, while Bradford thinks Leeds has pretensions above its station. They both could be right. For centuries, Bradford was the world capital of the wool trade. Following this industry's collapse, a large population of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis settled here and, despite occasional racial tensions, have helped reinvigorate the city and give it new energy. A high point of the year is a wonderful celebration of Asian music and dance called the Mela, part of the annual Bradford festival which is held every June.  The top sight for any visit to Bradford is the five-storey National Museum of Photography, Film & Television. It has a knockout collection of exhibits and features. Also well worth the time is the underrated Colour Museum, which explores the wool-dyeing trade, and the Bradford Industrial Museum.
