 Off the Beaten Track  The canyon of the R o Maipo is southeast of Santiago, and easily accessible by public transport. Hordes of santiaguinos head out here on weekends for some recreation, whether it's camping, hiking, climbing, whitewater rafting, skiing or cycling. The easygoing village of Pirque is one of the canyon's gateways, drawing in the throngs with its weekend craft market and Vi a Concha y Toro wine tours. A tributary canyon on the Maipo has been taken over by the Reserva Nacional R o Clarillo, one of the closest nature reserves to the capital. Its forested waterway is home to the endangered Chilean iguana. Further upriver there's San Alfonso and its Cascada de las Animas, a private nature reserve that successfully defied the Chilean government's plans to ram a natural gas pipeline through it. It's a former fundo (aristocrat's rural estate), and operates a campground and caba as, day trips and outdoor activities. Buses head out to Caj n del Maipo every 30 minutes from the Parque O'Higgins metro station.
