 Off the Beaten Track  During the day you can climb the Kaga hill about 3km (1.8mi) from town for good views of the dry country around about. In the evenings the market is lit up by oil lamps and you can get cheap food there, chat with the local people and sample the excellent local snifter, hydromiel, a type of beer made with honey. Grilled meat vendors ply the streets in the gare-routiere area, which really hops at night. Kaga Bandoro is 300km (186mi) north of Bangui, and you reach it by minibus.
