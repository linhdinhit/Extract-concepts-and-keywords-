 Environment  Singapore consists of the main, low-lying Singapore Island and 63 smaller islands within its territorial waters. Urban areas comprise almost 50% of the land area, while parkland, reservoirs, plantations and open military areas occupy 40%. Singapore Island measures approximately 42km (26mi) east to west and 23km (14mi) north to south at its widest points. While there are built-up, high-density areas all around the island, the main city area is in the south, built on the shores of the Singapore River. The Central Business District (CBD) is at the southern shore of the river's mouth. Chinatown adjoins the CBD to the southwest. To the north of the Singapore River is the colonial district, which has many reminders of British rule. Further north again is Little India and Arab St. Orchard Rd runs northwest from the colonial district.  To the west of the island is Jurong, an industrial area with a sprinkling of tourist attractions. The east coast has some of the older residential areas, a major beach park and the international airport. The northeast is the location of huge housing developments and the central north of the island has most of Singapore's undeveloped land and remaining forest. A 1km (0.6mi) causeway connects Singapore with Johor Bahru in Malaysia; a second causeway has opened on the west of the island to relieve congestion. Under current plans, land reclamation and housing developments should dramatically alter Singapore's geography.  Singapore is one giant sauna. It's hot and humid year-round, with the temperature almost never dropping below 20 C (68 F), even at night, and usually climbing to 30 C (86 F) during the day. Humidity is high, hovering around the 75% mark. Singapore is wettest from November to January and at its driest from May to July - the difference between the two, however, is slight. And due to Singapore's proximity to the equator, it receives a steady diet of sunshine all year.
