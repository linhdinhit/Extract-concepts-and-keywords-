 Attractions  One of the smallest capital cities in Africa, Banjul lies on an island at the mouth of the Gambia River, separated from the mainland by a narrow creek. Unable to grow, the city has been stagnant for years, giving it a sleepy, down-at-heel ambience, more like a large village than a national centre. If you've come to The Gambia to experience Africa, rather than a slice of Europe laid down on a tropical beach, this city is a far better bet than the nearby Atlantic coast resorts.  The vibrant heart of Banjul is Albert Market, a good place to pass a couple of hours strolling and shopping for clothes, shoes, fruits and vegetables, household goods and local handicrafts. Colourful, lively and chaotic, the market scene is Banjul at its African best. Nearby on MacCarthy Square, look for the War Memorial and the Fountain, erected to commemorate the coronation of Britain's King George VI in 1937.  Though some of its exhibits are looking a bit dog-eared these days, the National Museum of the Gambia is worth visiting for its displays of photos, maps and text about archaeology, African peoples and the colonial period. Not far off, the 35m (115ft) Arch 22 is by far the tallest building in Gambia. Built to celebrate the military coup of 22 July 1994 (led by Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh, now Gambia's president), the arch provides excellent views over the city and the coast, and it's open to the public daily.  When you're ready to get out of the city itself, local pirogues (skinny wooden boats with an outboard motor) ferry visitors on the quiet waterways of Oyster Creek, the main waterway separating Banjul island and the mainland. The creek (locally called a bolong) is a popular destination for bird-watchers, anglers and anyone keen to just laze around on a boat. The dense mangroves are particularly interesting.
