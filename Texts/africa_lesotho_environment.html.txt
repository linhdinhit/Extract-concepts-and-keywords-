 Environment  Lesotho (pronounced le-soo-too) is a mountainous kingdom completely surrounded by South Africa. It's roughly circular in shape and about the same size as Belgium. Lesotho's forbidding terrain and the defensive walls of the Drakensberg and Maluti ranges have given both sanctuary and strategic advantage to the Basotho (the people of Lesotho). All of Lesotho exceeds 1000m (3280ft) above sea level with peaks reaching to well over 3000m (9840ft). The tourist slogan, 'kingdom in the sky', is not far wrong, as Lesotho has the highest lowest point of any country in the world. To the west, the land descends through foothills to a lowland belt along the border where two-thirds of the population live. Three large rivers, the Orange, the Caledon and the Tugela, rise in the mountains.  For many, southern Africa's most impressive endowment is its flora, and Lesotho can claim a significant amount of credit for that, with a spectacular diversity of plantlife.  Incredible thunderstorms are common during the summer in Lesotho, with deadly lightning strikes reported every year. Eighty-five per cent of rainfall occurs from October to April, while snow occurs in the highlands from May to September. Despite the incredible storms, Lesotho usually boasts clear blue skies and more than 300 days of sunshine each year.
