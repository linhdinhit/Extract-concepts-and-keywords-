 Attractions  Before the war, Sarajevo was the most Oriental city in Europe, retaining the essence of its rich history with its mosques, markets and picturesque old Turkish bazaar. The city's riverfront remained largely unchanged since that fateful day in 1914 when Archduke Francis Ferdinand lost his life here. And from 70 years later, when Sarajevo again captured the world's attention by hosting the 1984 Winter Olympic Games, you could visit the arenas of competition.  For hundreds of years, Sarajevo had been a place where Muslims, Serbs, Croats, Turks, Jews and others could peacefully coexist, but this tradition of tolerance was pounded into rubble by Serbian artillery during the recent war, leaving over 10,000 people dead and 50,000 wounded.  Despite the barbarity of the three-year siege, Sarajevo has once again attained a degree of normalcy. The trams are running, many cafes and hotels have reopened and tourists have slowly begun to filter in. Early visitors tended to be 'war groupies,' interested in seeing first-hand the sites that had gained such a terrible notoriety during the war, but even that seems to be on the wane. With luck and time, Sarajevo may once again become a vibrant metropolis.
