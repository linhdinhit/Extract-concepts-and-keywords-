 Activities  Retrace the route of French trapper Louis Jolliet while you have an urban adventure by canoeing the Chicago River. Besides urban sprawl, you're likely to see deer, red fox, beaver and birds. You'll also see parks and houses being built that show that Chicago has finally discovered that its namesake river is good for more bucolic pursuits than as an industrial sewer. Kayaking can also be enjoyed on Lake Michigan and along the Chicago River. The best place to access both is from the Chicago Harbor at Navy Pier, where the Chicago River empties into Lake Michigan. Diversey Harbor, near downtown, is another good launching point.   Fishing has become a mayoral priority in Chicago, and a special Fishing Hotline has been set up to answer questions about what to catch, when to cast and how. Most of the lagoons in the parks are stocked in the summer, and charter boats take anglers trolling on Lake Michigan. Coho salmon, rainbow trout, chinook and perch are among the fish you'll find.  Once called 'the opiate of the masses', bowling is a distinctly Midwestern activity. People of all shapes, sizes and ages gather in boisterous groups to send balls crashing into a set of pins. Talent is not a prerequisite. The lanes are most crowded during the cold months. For bowling with charm, try Southport Lanes in Wrigleyville, a 75-year-old bar with 4 lanes and handset pins.
