 Attractions  As the name suggests, this museum on the Canadian Forces Base is full of displays of the past history of the Maritimes, so you can expect to see plenty of uniforms and medals. The museum is housed in an impressive stone building - it was the private residence of the commander-in-chief of the British Royal Navy in North America from 1819-1904 - and the grounds feature numerous cannons.
