 Off the Beaten Track  If you want to flee the traffic fumes, head for the foothills of the Alborz Mountains and the walking trails of Darakeh and Darband. Though you'll have to walk a bit to get out of the developed areas and the paths and streams tend to be strewn with litter, the walks are worth taking. Along each trail are cafes, kababis (kebab shops) and vendors selling tasty treats.
