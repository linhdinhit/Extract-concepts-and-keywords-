 When to Go  There's not really any best or worst time to visit Cape Town, although different seasons have their advantages. From late December to the end of January accommodation can be hard to find and prices rise. Easter and other school holidays are also busy times. You're more likely to encounter one of the famous southeasterly gales during spring ( September to November), but this might be an attraction, with huge waves rolling up from the Antarctic and pounding the coastline. In winter ( June through August) the weather can be a bit gloomy and, if the wind blows from the snowy peaks inland, chilly. However, there are plenty of clear days and the crowds have gone.     Events  South African public holidays underwent a serious shake-up after the 1994 elections. For example, the Day of the Vow, which marked the massacre of Zulus, has become the Day of Reconciliation (16 December). The officially ignored but widely observed Soweto Day, marking the student uprisings which eventually led to liberation, is now celebrated as Youth Day (16 June).  The Cape Festival used to be held annually in early March, with music from classical to jazz. Whether or not it starts up again has yet to be decided. Perhaps the biggest party in town is put on by the Cape Town Queer Project in mid-December, usually at the River Club. It has a different theme every year, outrageous fancy dress is compulsory and straights are welcome. A food and wine festival is held in Stellenbosch in October; Calvina has a Meat Festival in August; and Hermanus holds a Whale Festival in late September or early October. The university suburb of Observatory has a weekend festival/street party sometime in spring.
