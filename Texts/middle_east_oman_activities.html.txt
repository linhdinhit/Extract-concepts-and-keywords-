 Activities  The variety of terrain in Oman makes weekend mountain and desert motoring particularly worthwhile. Water sports are the recreational mainstay of many of the five-star hotels. The main ones in Muscat all either have a beach of their own or have rights to somebody else's, and sport small fleets of sailboats, windsurfers and pedal boats. Several have diving gear available for guests.
