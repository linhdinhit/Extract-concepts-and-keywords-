 When to Go  'Varied' is a vague but accurate way to describe the many moods of Scotland's cool temperate climate. The weather changes quickly - a rainy day is often followed by a sunny one. There are also wide variations over small distances; while one glen broods under a cloud, the next may be basking in sunshine. As some locals are wont to say, 'If you don't like the weather just wait five minutes.' May and June are generally the driest months, but expect rain at any time. Storms are rare April to August.     Events  Not to be outdone by Edinburgh, Glasgow has developed several festivals of its own, starting each January with a two-week Celtic music festival. Maydaze, in early May, is a new arts and dance festival. The West End Festival of music and the arts runs for two weeks in June, and it's currently Glasgow's biggest festival. The excellent International Jazz Festival is held in July. Glasgay! is a gay performing arts festival, held every two years around October/November.  Other festivals include the Scottish Proms (classical music) in mid-June and the World Pipe Band Championships in mid-August, with over 100 pipe bands.
