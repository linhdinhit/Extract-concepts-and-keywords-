 When to Go  Ask any Territorian when the best time to visit Darwin is and invariably they'll say the wet season (October to March). Everything is green, there's no dust, barramundi fishing is at its best, prices drop, there are spectacular electrical storms and all the tourists have gone home. The tourists have gone home for a reason - the humidity is often unbearable, roads are impassable, swimming in the ocean is impossible, and cyclones are something of a worry. Late wet, early dry is probably the best season, as the rains taper off and the humidity drops. Whatever season you arrive in, the temperature will most likely be between 30 C and 33 C (86 F and 91 F). If street parades are your thing, make your way here in August for the Festival of Darwin and the Beer Can Regatta.     Events  There are beach parties and rock concerts on May Day, more to celebrate the absence of box jellyfish and the start of swimming season than to pay tribute to International Labour Day. The Royal Darwin Show is held in July. Darwin's legendary thirst for beer is celebrated at the Beer Can Regatta in August, when a series of boat races are held for craft constructed entirely of beer cans. Other August festivities include the Rodeo and Mud Crab Tying Competition, and the Darwin Cup horse race.
