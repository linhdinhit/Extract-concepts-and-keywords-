Windsurfing and sailing are best at the start and end of the trade winds, usually around May and October. Some beaches are better during the monosoon season, others during the trade winds. Diving is best in March, April, May, September, October and November. Room rates are highest and everything is busiest in December, January, July and August.     Events  With its short history, the Seychelles isn't exactly overloaded with traditional festivals. Most public holidays are Roman Catholic events, including Easter, Corpus Christi, on 10 June, the Assumption, on 15 August, and the Immaculate Conception, on 8 December. The one major non-religious festival is Festival Kreol, which was set up to preserve and promote Creole culture. Held every year around the end of October, this week-long festival is an explosion of Creole cuisine, fashion, art, music and dance. Creole artists from all over the world descend on the Seychelles for this festival of street theatre.
