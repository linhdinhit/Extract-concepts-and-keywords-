 When to Go  While the winter months are cold and grey, the bars and clubs continue to operate, so you can always stay warm on the inside. For many, Leeds means Headingley, the test-level cricket ground and home to the Yorkshire County Cricket Club; summer is the time to see the cricketers in action. Summer also sees the most tourists in town; although many prefer to visit in April-June and September-October.     Events  If you want to get active, the Annual Otley 10 Mile Road Race, just north of Leeds, takes place in June. June is also the middle of the English cricket season, with Yorkshire games based around the beautiful Headingley ground. Just 10 minutes from town is Elland Road, home to the Leeds United Football Club. Games are played from August through to May. October sees the established Leeds International Film Festival, boasting over 400 films and film-related events. Kids' films get an airing at the Leeds Children & Young People's Film Festival in March.
