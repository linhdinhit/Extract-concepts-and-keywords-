 Off the Beaten Track  Nara (population 350,000) is known as the birthplace of Japanese culture, and became Japan's first permanent capital in 710. The city acted as the eastern terminus of the legendary Silk Road, the ancient trading route between Asia and Europe, and today is the number two tourist attraction in Kansai after Kyoto. Though at first uninspiring, careful inspection of this ancient city will reveal its hidden beauty and rich history. Nara's best sites include the Nara-koen deer park, with around 1200 deer, the Kofuku-ji Temple, also built in 710 and still largely intact, and Todai-ji Temple, the world's largest wooden building and home to the Great Buddha - one of the largest bronze images in the world.
