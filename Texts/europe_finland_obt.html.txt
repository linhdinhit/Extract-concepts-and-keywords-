 Off the Beaten Track  The most interesting thing to see in idyllic Kristinestad (Kristiinankaupunki in Finnish) - founded in 1649 - is the town itself, where old customs still survive. The narrowest street in town, known as Catwhipper's Lane, is only 299cm wide, making it one of the narrowest streets in Finland. In the 1880s, in an effort to contain the plague, the town employed a cat-catcher to kill sick cats - hence the name of the street. In the centre of town is Ulrika Eleonora's Church, built in the 18th century. It's a typical coastal church, with votive ships hanging from the ceiling. The town's Maritime Museum houses a private collection of sea-related items collected by an old sea captain. Kristinestad sits along the west coast of Finland and can be reached by buses from Pori, Vaasa and Tampere.
