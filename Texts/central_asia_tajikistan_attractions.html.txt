 Attractions  With a cool backdrop of mountains, lazy tree-lined avenues and pale, oriental-fringed buildings, Dushanbe may be a good-looking city but personality-wise it's a dead loss. It's an historically isolated backwater that's boring by day and dangerous at night. The large, covered Barakat market is what passes for the centre of activity in Dushanbe, though it's not particularly interesting; the city has many other makeshift bazars, but they're harrowing affairs composed of lines of people trying to sell whatever they can find at home - a pair of old shoes, coverless books, a dismantled washing machine motor, anything that somebody might conceivably trade a little cash for.  The city does have two interesting museums: the professional Museum of Ethnography, which showcases Tajik art such as pottery, carpets, jewellery and musical instruments, and the Tajikistan Unified Museum, which has interesting exhibits on history, natural history and art. It's worth seeing a performance at Ayni Opera & Ballet Theatre since it has the finest interior in the city.
