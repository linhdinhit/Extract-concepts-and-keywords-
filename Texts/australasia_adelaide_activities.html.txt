 Activities  There are several bushwalking clubs in the Adelaide area which organise weekend walks in the Mt Lofty Ranges. There is good sailing all along the Adelaide shoreline of the Gulf of St Vincent. Beaches close to the city, such as Seacliff, Brighton, Somerton and Glenelg offer excellent swimming, though you have to go a litte further afield for surfing. There's an artificial reef designed for divers off Glenelg beach. You can go ice-skating or skiing year-round at the indoor rink and slope in Thebarton.
