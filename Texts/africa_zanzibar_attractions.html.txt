 Attractions  The king of the archipelago, Zanzibar island is an unusual melange of the Africa of the imagination, conservative Muslim tendencies and coastal glamour, and will enthral most travellers. The most interesting part of Zanzibar Town, on the western side of the island, is Stone Town. Its name may be unimaginative, but Stone Town is an enticing place to wander away a languid afternoon. Meander through the narrow alleyways and let your jaw drop at the town's unique architecture that fuses Arabic, Indian, European and African influences (and rest assured not all the buildings are made of stone). The elegant Beit el-Ajaib (House of Wonders) was rebuilt after the British made their displeasure felt and bombed the area in the late-19th century; its enormous doors are said to be the largest in East Africa. Beit al-Sahel (Palace Museum) served as the Sultan's residence until 1964 when the dynasty was overthrown. It's now a museum devoted to the era of the Zanzibar sultanate. The Old Fort, a massive, bastioned structure built by Omani Arabs on the site of a Portuguese chapel is also worth a peek. It houses the Zanzibar Cultural Centre, has an open-air theatre, an art gallery and a cafe. There are daily flights and ferries between Dar es Salaam, on the mainland, and Zanzibar.  For amazing wildlife snooping, Jozani Forest is home to rare red colobus monkeys, Sykes monkeys, bushbabies, Ader's duikers, hyraxes and more species of butterflies and birds than you can point your camera at. The forest is about 35km (22mi) southeast of Zanzibar Town, and can be reached by bus or chartered taxi.
