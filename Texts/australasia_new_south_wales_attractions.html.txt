 Attractions  Built on the picturesque shores of Port Jackson, Sydney is all about superlatives - Australia's oldest city, largest metropolis and weirdest architecture (think the sea-shell Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge that most locals call the Big Coat Hanger). Hosting the 2000 Olympics cemented Sydney's reputation as a world party city, but NSW's big smoke is also a big joke, with locals known for their real-estate obsession, mobile-phone toting and slavish devotion to the latest fads ('Did someone soy latte with a twist of lemon, darling?').   Sydney Harbour's sandstone headlands, dramatic cliffs and stunning beaches define the city. The grand dame of the sandy shores is Bondi, a sunny spread of coast hemmed with an eclectic mix of ice-cream parlours, designer cafes, surf stores, kosher purveyors and good old-fashioned fish and chip joints.  The city's focal point is Circular Quay, the site of Australia's first settlement and more recently the Museum of Contemporary Art and Sydney Opera House. The Rocks is Sydney's charming historic precinct, complete with cobblestoned streets, colonial buildings, a weekend market and the Sydney Observatory. Metamorphosing into a modern tourist and leisure zone during the 1980s, Darling Harbour is a progressive seaside development boasting the Sydney Aquarium, the Chinese Garden and the nearby Powerhouse Museum.   The Domain is an expanse of grassland established in the city as an area of public recreation, with its treasured Art Gallery of New South Wales featuring Australian, European, Japanese and tribal art along with some brilliant visiting exhibits. The Royal Botanic Gardens are east of Circular Quay and showcase the colony's first vegetable patch as well as a stunning collection of South Pacific plant life. The Domain and the gardens are prime territory for picnics and wedding photos.
