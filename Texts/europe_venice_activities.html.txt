 Activities  Being as tightly packed as the city is, Venice does not make an ideal place to come to practise your favourite sport. Just walking around and up and down bridges means that you're likely to be getting a pretty good workout! If you've got any energy left after all that walking, try a spot of swimming off the Lido (if you're game) or at one of Venice's two public swimming pools (they close in summer). In case you want to emulate Julia Roberts in Everybody Says I Love You and do some jogging - as if! - try the Giardini Pubblici or Isola di Sant'Elena in Castello. You could indulge in a spot of rowing at Venice's oldest club, Reale Societa Canottieri Bucintoro. There are also a few small gyms where you can pump some iron and hit the treadmill. Alternatively, you can stay indoors and do some courses: choose from Italiano, cooking, history, art and music.
