 Off the Beaten Track  White sand beaches make Kribi Cameroon's best seaside resort. Aside from some restaurants and a disco, there's little to do in town, but there are some inviting fishing villages nearby with excellent fresh seafood. If you make it during the dry periods of mid-October to November or March to May you'll miss the rain and the crowds of expats from Douala. The best nearby villages are Eboundja (20km/12mi south) and Londji (24km/15mi north); the latter is spread around an immense bay with pristine sand and palm trees. Neither place has amenities, but they're great for lying back and enjoying some grilled fish and palm wine with the locals. Kribi is about two hours south of Douala by bush taxi.
