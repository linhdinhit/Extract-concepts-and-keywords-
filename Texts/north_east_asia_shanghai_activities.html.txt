 Activities  There is no shortage of heartrate-raising, sweat-inducing activities in and around Shanghai. Western-style health clubs are becoming more common, otherwise try a hotel gym. The French Concession offers some charming areas for cycling, and the ambitious can head out of the city to Sheshan or even Suzhou. For swimming, the Shanghai Swimming Pool opens to the public on weekends only, there are hotel pools, or try the Ocean World water park. Shanghai Stadium has public badminton courts, and there are public tennis courts near the stadium or you can play at the Xianxia Tennis Centre. There are more than 200 tenpin bowling alleys in Shanghai to try. The north entrance of Shanghai Stadium has skate/skateboard ramps. Golf courses have invaded the suburbs of Shanghai; as elsewhere, it's a sport of the well-to-do. Check the expat rags for information on a host of other sports, including martial arts. A massage, while not strictly active, is a great antidote to too much exercise. Get a local to direct you to a legitimate, small specialist massage clinic.
