 Environment  Benin is located in West Africa, and covers a land area of 110,620 sq km (44,000 sq mi). The country is a long stretch of land perpendicular to the Coast of the Gulf of Guinea. It is bordered on the north by Burkina Faso and the Republic of Niger, on the east by the Federal Republic of Nigeria and on the west by the Republic of Togo. The coastline is 124km (77mi) long across the south, with the land stretching north-south for 672km (420mi) from the Niger River to the Bight of Benin. It is about two-thirds the size of Portugal and a fraction smaller than Pennsylvania.  The country is divided into five natural regions: a coastal area; a plateau zone called "la terre de barre"; another plateau with wooded savannah; a hilly region in the northwest (the Atakora), which contains the water reservoir for Benin and Niger; and the fertile Niger plains in the northeast. In the south, cultivated land including immense palmgroves and coconut plantations lines the coast.
