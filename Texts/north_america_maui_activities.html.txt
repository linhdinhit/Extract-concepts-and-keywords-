 Activities  People come to Maui for the beaches and watersports - the island has some of Hawaii's (and the world's) best windsurfing and boardsurfing, as well as plenty of good swimming, snorkeling and bodysurfing. For a quiet swim, try Slaughterhouse Beach in the north. Surfing is good on the windward northern and eastern coasts, with Hookipa Beach near Paia arguably the most consistent spot. Maalaea Pipeline, on the southern side of Maalaea Bay, is one of the world's top 10 breaks, and Honolua Bay on the northwestern coast is also excellent. Expert windsurfers absolutely must go to Hookipa Beach. Spreckelsville in Paia is good for advanced windsurfers, while Kanaha in Kahului is a top beginners' spot.  The best diving destination is the sunken volcanic crater of nearby Molokini, where the fish are tame and the water is clear, although the less-crowded neighboring island of Lanai is also great. For beach snorkeling, the easily accessible Black Rock at Kaanapali is good, and Kapalua Bay is calm year round.  Although the water's the place to be on Maui, there's also a fair bit to do inland. Haleakala National Park has some extraordinary hiking through its volcanic crater, and the whole island is crisscrossed with nature walks. Haleakala is also popular with horseback riders, and cyclists get a buzz from coasting 38 miles (60km) down the steep-sided mountain. Real keensters can hang-glide from Haleakala to the coast, a scenic descent of nearly 10,000ft (3000m).
