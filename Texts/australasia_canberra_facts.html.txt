 When to Go  Autumn (March to May) in Canberra is quite simply gorgeous. The days are sunny and crisp, the trees are changing and everything looks lovely. Winter (June to August) is cold; really, really cold. There are mornings when it feels like breathing in will crack your lungs, but the sky is usually blue and the weather is sunny. Spring (September to November) is much wetter and windier, though the very popular Floriade festival brightens things up. Summer (December to February) can be just a bit too hot.     Events  The Canberra Festival celebrates the city's birthday over 10 days in March with music, food, a mardi gras, displays, a raft race and a parade. March also brings the huge National Folk Festival to Canberra. Spring is celebrated with the Floriade Festival, when Commonwealth Park becomes a riot of floral colour. Canberra is best avoided at New Year when the Street Machine Summer Nats brings hot-rods and wet t-shirt competitions to the nation's capital.
