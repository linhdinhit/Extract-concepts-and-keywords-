 Attractions  Few visitors to Madrid would want to miss out on a visit to one of the art world's holy grails. Lovers of Spanish art will particularly enjoy the coverage given to the big three - Vel zquez, Goya and El Greco. Minor Spanish artists such as de Ribera and Murillo are also represented, along with a fair sprinkling of Flemish and Italian masters. Of course, with a museum this size you really should visit more than once, particularly as fewer than half of the collection is ever on view at any given time.  Don't miss Madrid's other two art fests, the Thyssen-Bornemisza and Reina Sof a collections, representing (respectively) European and modern Spanish movements. The Reina Sof a collection is dominated by Picasso's masterly Guernica.
