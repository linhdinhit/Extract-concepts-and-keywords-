 Off the Beaten Track  Bayamo is the capital of Granma Province, the country's southernmost point, and the region sees few tourists. This area was important in the Cuban struggle for freedom: Castro and 81 rebels landed at Cabo Cruz aboard the Granma (hence the province's name) on 2 December 1956, and the first War of Independence was launched here in October 1868 when Creole planter Carlos Manuel de Cespedes freed his slaves, formed a militia and overran the eastern end of the island. The area has a wealth of historic places of interest, including the site where Jose Mart was shot, and one of Cuba's greatest national parks, Gran Parque Nacional Sierra Maestra, to the south of Bayamo township. Bayamo has a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere and makes few concessions to tourism. The town is centered around Parque Cespedes, which is a delightful, shady park containing long marble benches and statues of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes and Perucho Figueredo (who composed the Cuban national anthem in 1868 to coincide with Cespedes' revolution). On the north side of the park is the Ayuntamiento, and it was in front of this in 1868 that Cespedes proclaimed independence for Cuba.
