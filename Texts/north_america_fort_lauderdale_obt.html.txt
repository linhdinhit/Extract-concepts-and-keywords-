 Off the Beaten Track  Where there's nature left in southeast Florida, it's best to see it fast, and the Hugh Taylor Birch State Recreation Area is one of the spots to see. For almost a mile in the middle of the beach (north of East Sunrise Blvd), the state-protected park contains one of the last significant maritime hammocks left around Fort Lauderdale, mangroves, a freshwater lagoon system and several species of endangered flora and fauna, including the gopher tortoise and golden leather fern. Oh yeah - there's luscious peace and quiet here as well. The park allows beach access, and within the grounds you can fish in the Intracoastal Waterway, picnic, hike, bike or canoe.
