 Activities  The choices are fairly limited on this tiny group of islands, partly because there are simply not enough visitors to warrant much tourist structure. A relaxing island circuit by scooter is perhaps the best way to spend your time. Exploring archeological sites, hiking around the crater lakes and visiting the various churches are all recommended. Although there are good beaches, you have to make some effort to get to them. Still, lying under a palm tree is one of the essential Pacific activities, so get yourself out to Alofi or one of Wallis' lagoon islands.  A leisurely game of golf or Polynesian cricket or, if you're lucky, an invitation to share some kava with Futunan locals are probably the most typical local activities you might get involved in. Break up your physical exertions by partaking in the French-influenced cuisine and wine, but be warned, this sort of luxury in the middle of the Pacific Ocean doesn't come cheap.
