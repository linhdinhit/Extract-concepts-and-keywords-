 Environment  A tiny speck on France's eastern Mediterranean coast, Monaco weighs in at an awesome 1.95 sq km. There isn't a great deal of geographic variety possible in such a small area. Most of the country is hilly, rugged and rocky, and there are some very fetching sea cliffs.  Those keen on wildlife spotting are best advised to visit the Monaco aquarium. The country is almost entirely urban and not the best place for nature lovers. With no forest or woodland cover left here, the only fauna you're likely to see are cockroaches, alley cats and other tourists.  Monaco's climate is typically Mediterranean, with a bit of rain but not too much chill in the winter. Summers are dry and can get very hot. The Monegasque claim they enjoy 300 days of sunshine a year.
