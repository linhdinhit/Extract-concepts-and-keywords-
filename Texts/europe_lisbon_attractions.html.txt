 Attractions  Portugal's caravels sailed off to conquer the great unknown from Belem, and today this leafy riverside precinct is a giant monument to the nation's Age of Discoveries. First stop should be the Mosteiro dos Jer nimos, a Manueline masterpiece whose intricate decoration and peaceful spaces will leave you inspired. A short walk away is the Torre de Belem, the much-photographed symbol of Portugal's maritime glory. The imposing limestone Monument to the Discoveries, also facing the river nearby, is shaped like a caravel and features key players from the era. When you've digested enough maritime history, head off to the famous Antiga Confeitaria de Belem for some delicious pasteis de Belem (traditional custard tarts). If you have time, look around the Centro Cultural de Belem, one of Lisbon's main cultural venues, which houses the Museo do Design, a collection of 20th-century mind-bogglers.
