 Off the Beaten Track  Sur has a lot going for it, starting with a nearly ideal location. It's a quiet place but has great beaches, impressive forts, a great Marine Museum and an active dhow yard where traditional fishing vessels are built. At any given time, a dozen or more dhows may be under construction, making this a great place to visit. Just beyond the dhow yard is a small ferry that will carry you across the narrow sound to Ayega, a village where many of the dhow builders live. Although Sur is only 150km (93mi) down the coast from Muscat as the crow flies, by road it is a bit over twice that distance, making it an effort to get to. There are three buses a day between Muscat and Sur.
