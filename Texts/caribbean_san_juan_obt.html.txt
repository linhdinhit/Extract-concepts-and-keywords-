 Off the Beaten Track  You needn't genuflect at the Bacardi Rum Factory, on the western shore of the Bahia de San Juan, but it always makes the slightly cheesy tour more interesting if you sample some of the product before you begin. The tour includes a trolley tour of the distillery and bottling plant, a modest museum and a free rum cocktail. You can stock up for your next daiquiri party at the gift shop. Take a ferry from the pier in Old San Juan across the bay to Cata o, where there are shuttle vans to the distillery.  For those who like their distilleries as aged as their rum, there's the nearby Barrilito Rum Distillery, which occupies a 200-year-old mansion. A little farther south are the Caparra ruins, the remains of the island's first settlement. You can view artifacts from the ruins at the immodestly named Museum of the Conquest and Colonization of Puerto Rico.
