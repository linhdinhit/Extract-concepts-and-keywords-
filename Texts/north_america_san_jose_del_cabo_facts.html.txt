 When to Go  While Baja California's Pacific coastline is blessed with relatively mild temperatures year-round thanks to the cooling effect of a strong current originating in the Subarctic, the Gulf coast - including the cape on which San Jose del Cabo is located - can heat up dramatically in summer, with temperatures in excess of 40 C (104 F). The cape region is also prone to summertime storms and the occasional chubasco (hurricane) due to tropical lows in the Pacific. During winter, on the other hand, temperatures in the area stay pretty warm and the sun just keeps on shining, making this an excellent climate in which to visit. Of course, the average daily winter high of 23 C (73 F) means this is also the time when most northern hemisphere visitors arrive, greedily seeking a second summer.  If more hours of daylight is a higher priority than physical comfort, travel to the area during horario de verano (daylight saving time), which lasts from the first Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October. Prices throughout Baja California are almost double the charges levied in most other parts of Mexico, so you'll be faced with a costly excursion no matter which time of year you visit.     Events  To see some of the best pre-Lent festivities in the country, head over to La Paz (capital of Baja California Sur) in late February for the local Carnaval, which overflows with parades, fireworks and frenetic partying. San Jose del Cabo's patron saint, St Joseph, gets his celebratory comeuppance on 19 March during the Fiesta de San Jose, when the town hosts everything from street dances to horse races and food fairs. The local church, Iglesia San Jose, becomes the centre of devoted attention when Holy Week begins the countdown to Easter in March or April. La Paz is again in high spirits from 15 to 16 September when mariachi bands salute the anniversary of the D a de la Independencia, marking the start of Mexican independence from Spain in 1821.
