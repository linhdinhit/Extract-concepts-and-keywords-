 Attractions  Scenically located on the shores of the inner Moray Firth, at the northern end of the Great Glen, Inverness is the bustling capital of the Highlands. Visitors flock to the town in summer, using it as a base while they experience the region's remote open spaces or enjoy a little monster hunting at nearby Loch Ness. It is also well worth spending some time strolling and birdwatching along the picturesque River Ness or cruising on the Moray Firth in search of its 100 or so bottlenose dolphins.  One of the town's major attractions is Inverness Castle, a 19th-century replacement of the 15th-century original, blown up by the Jacobites in 1746. Today it serves as the local sheriff's court. The Drum Tower houses the Castle Garrison Encounter, where actors representing characters from the Hanoverian army of 1746 attempt to bring history alive. In front of the castle stands a statue of the ubiquitous Highland heroine Flora MacDonald, who helped Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape, following his defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.  Thanks to Inverness' often turbulent history and, in more recent times, dubious planning decisions, relatively few buildings of real age have survived. Much of the town dates from the completion of Telford's Caledonian Canal in 1822, but older structures include the 1593 Abertarff House and the 1668 Dunbar's Hospital, both in Church St. Across the river and south along the bank lie St Andrew's Cathedral, dating from 1866-69, and the modern Eden Court Theatre, which hosts regular art exhibits. It's also worth a stroll around Ness Islands, connected to the riverbanks by footbridges.
