 Off the Beaten Track  If a visit to the Caves Monastery in Kiev leaves you thirsting for more in the ecclesiastical vein, the monastery in Pochayiv is the second largest in the country. The site is sacred to all devout Ukrainians and is flooded with pilgrims during religious festivals. The main Uspensky Cathedral (1771-83) is an overwhelming Baroque affair. Its interior, able to hold over 6000 people, is a breathtaking expression of Orthodox iconography - nearly every surface is lavishly and masterfully painted and gilded with saints and patriarchs. The 1597 Mother of God icon is believed to have protective powers.  Built over 100 years earlier, the gold-domed Holy Trinity Cathedral nearby is smaller and darker, with massive pillars and thick vaults beneath a deep cupola creating a quiet atmosphere of weighty spiritualism. Directly west of the Holy Trinity Cathedral is the mid-19th century bell tower, a 65m (215ft) Baroque structure with a fine view and a 11,180kg (11 ton) bell. Pochayiv is in the middle of Western Ukraine, 300km (185mi) west of Kiev. There's a bus depot just west of the monastery grounds where buses arrive from Kremenets (40 minutes), Ternopil (2 hours) and Lviv (6 hours).
