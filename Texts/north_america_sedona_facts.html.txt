 When to Go  While things start hotting up between March and May, averages are still well below the 95 F-plus (around 35 C) range of July and August, and always cooler than Phoenix. Rainfall is moderate at this time. September to December are the peak times for local festivals and events. Having said that, unless the heat really bothers you, there isn't a bad time to be in this area.     Events  There's more to Sedona than vortex-viewing. More than 7000 people regularly scat along to the annual Sedona Jazz on the Rocks festival, held just outside town every September. September also sees the recently-inaugurated Sedona Eco-Fest. Part carnival, part education and mostly music, this ecology-friendly event is a great one for the kids. Early March is the usual time for the Sedona Film Festival, a three-day event that brings independent film to the town.
