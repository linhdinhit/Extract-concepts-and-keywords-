 Attractions  What began in the 1930s as a boyish challenge has become one of Acapulco's most famous spectacles. It's hard to beat the drama and touch of madness of the clavadistas who gracefully launch themselves from heights of up to 45m (148ft) into a narrow chasm, timing their fall to meet the surf crashing below. The divers first scale the cliff face, then wisely pray at a small shrine before leaping over the edge (so did Elvis Presley in the film Fun in Acapulco). There are five daily performances with at least three divers performing each time, each trying to outdo the others in showmanship. During the last show of the evening they carry flaming torches. Afterwards the performers gather to accept tips, and will happily share their stories - and their scars.  There's a great view of the action from the terraces of the Plaza Las Glorias El Mirador Hotel, where celebrities have scrawled their admiration for the divers on the wall. La Quebrada is also a superb spot for watching sunsets. It's easy to get there on foot or by taxi from the Z calo (town square).
