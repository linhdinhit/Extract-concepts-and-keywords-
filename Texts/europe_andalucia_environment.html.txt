 Environment  Andaluc a looks a bit like a Portugal-sized horizontal sausage at the bottom of Spain. It's 550km (340mi) from east to west and between 90km (56mi) and 250km (155mi) from north to south. The coastline is shared between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean with the seas joining at the bottom in the Strait of Gibraltar. Tarifa, continental Europe's southernmost town, is only 15km (9mi) from Africa. Andaluc a is divided into eight provinces (Huelva, Seville, C rdoba, Jaen, C diz, M laga, Granada and Almer a) and four geographical areas: the Sierra Morena, the Guadalquivir valley, the mountains and the coastal plain.  A relative absence of industry and archaic agriculture have left Andaluc a with a fairly clean environment. The leakage of poisonous mining wastes in 1998 - which caused damage to areas around the Parque Nacional de Donama in western Andaluc a - was a rare blip. Almost two-thirds of Spain's natural parks are in Andaluc a. The region has over 90 protected areas, bursting with flora and fauna. There are 5000 species of plants, of which 150 are endemic to the mountainous areas. Wildlife-spotters can spy wolves, ibex, Pardel lynx, and various nocturnal species including the genet, wild boar and badger. Gibraltar is famous for its colony of Barbary macaques - the only wild monkeys in Europe. Andaluc a becomes a round-the-clock butterfly farm from spring to autumn. It's also home to 13 indigenous species of birds of prey and several summer visitors: look out for the rare black vulture (Europe's largest bird) and the Spanish imperial eagle. The vast humid areas on the Atlantic coast are popular with water birds.
