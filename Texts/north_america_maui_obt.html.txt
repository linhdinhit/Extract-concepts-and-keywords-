 Off the Beaten Track  Kula, the center of Maui's Upcountry and just off Hwy 37, is the agricultural heartland of the island. Crops such as lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, cauliflower and cabbage thrive, due to Kula's warm days, cool nights and rich volcanic soil, and no Hawaiian gourmet would be without sweet Kula onions. The area also grows most of Hawaii's proteas, carnations and chrysanthemums - no one would get leid in Hawaii if it weren't for Kula. During the California Gold Rush in the 19th century, Kula's farmers shipped so many potatoes off to the miners that the area became known as Nu Kaleponi, or New California.  All of Kula is a garden, but if you want to take a closer look, you can visit several established walk-through gardens. Clouds' Rest Protea Farm has a little garden with plants identified by plaques. Kula Botanical Gardens is a mature garden of tropical plants, overgrown and shady, while the more recently established Enchanting Floral Gardens is sunny, open and colorful. The University of Hawaii maintains an Agricultural Research Center here that specializes in developing new protea hybrids. If you feel the need to offer thanks for this floral abundance, the octagonal Holy Ghost Church (built in 1897 by Portuguese immigrants) has a beautifully ornate Iberian interior.
