 Off the Beaten Track  In the southwest corner of the suburb Richmond is the old fishing village of Steveston, Canada's largest commercial fishing port. Steveston was settled largely by Japanese immigrants in the early 20th century. However, during WWII nearly all the Japanese Canadians were sent to internment camps inland, and their boats and homes were auctioned off. The Steveston Museum tells some of their stories, as well as giving an overview of the town's fishing past. There's more history to be had at Gulf of Georgia Cannery National Historic Site, a museum of the region's maritime past. It's housed in an old fish cannery; if little else, the cannery tours do reveal why you'd never wish to be a fish.  The old part of town that fronts onto Fraser River is quite charming, and has a number of good restaurants and pubs. There's lots of activity in the harbor, and the sights and smells of the fishing fleets make for a good escape from the rush of downtown Vancouver. To get to Steveston, take bus Nos 490 or 491 from Burrard Station.
