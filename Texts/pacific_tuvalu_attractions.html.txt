 Attractions  With a population of over 4000, the Tuvaluan capital, Funafuti, remains a pretty low-key town. With no heavy industry and only two manufacturing facilities (textiles and soap), the air remains pure and the pace of life measured. Funafuti is an administrative centre, hosting a cluster of government buildings near the airport (the landing strip of which is also the town's main soccer pitch) and a church.Ten minutes walk north of the centre is the island's main village, while a further ten minutes on is the deep water wharf. The huge lagoon is a visual highlight, but tread carefully, as the lagoon beach doubles as a public toilet for some locals. With a population density of 1454 people per sq km, the island is comparatively crowded. If you've got no access to a private yacht and no patience to wait for other island-hopping options you can charter a boat to Funafala Island or one of the other uninhabited islets at the south end of the lagoon for a more unspoilt scene.
