 Activities  When it comes to outdoor activities, Aussie rules football rules, at least in winter. In summer, cricket and tennis come to the fore. Cycling is popular - there are a number of cycling trails and the big daddy of them all is the Main Yarra Trail, which follows the Yarra River eastwards from the city for over 30km (19mi). Inline skating is also big, especially along the beachside path from Port Melbourne to St Kilda and Brighton.  There is interesting bushwalking in the parks and forest reserves surrounding Melbourne. Urbanites in the know power walk and jog around Albert Park Lake and the 'Tan' (around the Kings Domain and Royal Botanic Gardens), and there are several interesting heritage walks around the city.  The Yarra and the bay offer a multitude of water sports: think canoeing, fishing, boating, sailing, windsurfing and sailboarding. You can surf on the ocean sides of the Bellarine and Mornington peninsulas, or swim in the slightly dirty bathwater of the Bay or in one of the city's many indoor and outdoor public pools. Melbourne's snowfields are all within two to five hours' drive, and both downhill and cross-country skiing are available. Melbourne also has numerous public and private golf courses, several of which are world famous.
