 Attractions  When Las Vegas was just a blip in the desert, Reno was serving up a tantalizing mixture of sex, liquor and chance. Its glittering prizes may be outshone these days, but plenty of folks still visit in the hope of a date with Lady Luck. Most of Reno's casinos are downtown, in the North Virginia St area. Casinos here are much more business-like than those in Las Vegas - the 'theme casino' is just starting to make its presence felt, and you're much more likely to be offered a combination of gambling and occasional entertainment than a three-ring circus with dancing girls. The venerable Harrah's is one such traditional casino, still one of the biggest and fanciest, and one of the best places to watch a lot of people lose a lot of money. If you insist on gimmicks, Circus Circus has Vegas-style circus acts, while Silver Legacy Resort has an imitation mining rig with a sound and light show.  Out in the suburbs, Peppermill wows the punters with psychedelic decor, and Fun Quest gets them in early with a superb video arcade. If your interest in gambling is purely academic, take a tour with the Reno-Tahoe Gaming Academy, who'll give you all the inside info as well as teaching you the ins and outs of your favorite games.
