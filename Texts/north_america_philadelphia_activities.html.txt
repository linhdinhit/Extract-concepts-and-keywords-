 Activities  The huge Fairmount Park is the city's main center for outdoor activities and the world's largest landscaped urban park. With around 100 miles (161km) of jogging and cycling paths and the Schuylkill River and Wissahickon Creek within its borders, the park is popular with city residents looking for a breath of fresh air. Rowing and canoeing are popular on the Schuylkill.   Hiking doesn't get much better than it is in Poconos' Delaware Water Gap, which includes 25 miles (40km) of the Appalachian Trail. The Switchback Gravity Railroad Trail, an abandoned railroad bed in Lehigh Gorge State Park (part of the Poconos) is great for mountain biking. There's good sailing on Mauch Chunk Lake and Lake Wallenpaupeck, both in the Poconos.
