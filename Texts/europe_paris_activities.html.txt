 Activities  Water enthusiasts are well catered for in Paris - there are around 30 swimming pools and the Aquaboulevard water park, too. And, among uniquely Parisian activities, it's hard to beat drifting lazily down the Seine (or the Marne, the Oise or any of the city's canals) in a canal boat. (Rentals are available year-round.) Be it on tarmac or slippery ice, Paris has discovered skating in a big way. In winter the Patinoire du Parvis de la Defense and Patinoire de l'H tel de Ville bring ice skating into the public arena. When it comes to aerobics, weight training and so on, gyms and fitness clubs are a penny a barrel. One of the best bowling alleys in Paris, Bowling de Paris, can be found in the Bois de Boulogne. If this isn't enough, Paris' weekly entertainment pamphlets, Pariscope and L'Officiel des Spectacles, list up-to-date information in French on every imaginable outdoor activity. Look for listings on randonnees pedestres (hiking in groups), cyclisme (biking), escalade (rock climbing), plus parachuting, canoeing, squash, tennis and more.
