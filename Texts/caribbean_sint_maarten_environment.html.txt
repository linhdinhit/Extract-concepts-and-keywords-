 Environment  Sint Maarten is located near the northern end of the Lesser Antilles, 325km (200mi) east of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Its nearest neighbors are Anguilla, 22km (14mi) north, and St Barthelemy (St Barts), 25km (15mi) southeast. Occupying the lower half of a triangular island that it shares with the French St Martin (a sub-prefecture of Guadeloupe), Sint Maarten is just under 15km (9mi) at its widest point and about 5km (3mi) from north to south. The shoreline is indented with bays and coves and the coastal flats are pocketed with salt ponds. The interior is hilly. The west side of the country is more water than land, dominated by the expansive Simpson Bay Lagoon, one of the largest landlocked bodies of water in the Caribbean.  The terrain is largely green but dry, with more palms, hibiscus and cacti than ferns or forests, although there are a few thickly vegetated areas in the interior. Herons, egrets, stilts, pelicans, laughing gulls and other shorebirds are plentiful in the island's brackish ponds. Frigatebirds can be spotted along the coastline, hummingbirds and bright yellow-bellied bananaquits are common in gardens and there are colorful woodland birds in the hills. Lizards are abundant and can be seen scurrying about on walkways and in other sunny areas.  The average daily high temperature is 28 C (83 F) in January, 30 C (86 F) in July. The average low temperature rarely dips below 22 C (72 F).
