 Activities  You dive in Bonaire. There are 40 top sites on the leeward coast alone, many within a few meters of shore. There are hawksbill turtles, peacock flounders, stingrays and seahorses off Pink Beach on the southwestern coast. There are good spots a bit farther north at the Salt Pier, where angelfish slalom among the coral-encrusted pilings. The wreck of the Hilma Hooker lies in 30m (100ft) of water near the Salt Pier. The ship's cargo of marijuana bales was its ticket to the deep - customs officers confiscated the load and sank the boat. Snorkelers can find dozens of good spots, including groves of elkhorn and staghorn coral just off Klein Bonaire, and the shallow waters of Boca Slagbaai, in Washington-Slagbaai National Park.  Constant trade winds make Bonaire a super sailing destination; anchoring is prohibited within the Marine Park but there are marinas around the island, one right by Kralendijk. There's decent windsurfing and kayaking at Lac Bay and Sorobon Beach on Bonaire's pin-drop quiet southeastern coast, though folk heading this way are likely to be off to drop their jocks at Sorobon's naturist resort.   Birders flock to Bonaire and not just for the tens of thousands of flamingoes who call the island home. There are dozens of native species and many more who pass by while migrating to South America. The flamingo sanctuaries at Goto Meer in the northwest and Pekelmeer in the south are vast tracts of feathery pink. You can also see frigatebirds, pelicans, red-necked pigeons and five different species of heron.  The island's nearly 300km (186mi) of roads and trails make mountain biking a good way to see the country. Unleash your inner paleoanthropologist by pedaling up to the northeastern coast and inspecting the Caiquetio Indian petroglyphs in the Boca Onima Caves. If the hilly northern end seems too strenuous, the southern flatlands are an easier ride. The 1835 Willemstoren Lighthouse near the tip of the island makes a fine picnic stop.
