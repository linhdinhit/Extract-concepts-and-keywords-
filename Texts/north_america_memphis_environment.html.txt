 Environment  Tennessee's knobbly central basin slips westward into the Tennessee River Valley, which in turn gives way to the rolling hill country of Western Tennessee. Tennesseans divide the state strictly into East, Middle and West, though these divisions are imprinted more in regional psychology than in topography.  For most visitors, western Tennessee means Memphis, and in many ways Memphis is more about Mississippi than it is about Tennessee: It's blacker, bluesier and better for barbecue than anywhere else in the state. Spring and autumn are the best seasons for sightseeing.
