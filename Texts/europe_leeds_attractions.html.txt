 Attractions  Leeds' pride and joy is the purpose-built, castle-like building that houses the impressive Royal Armouries, on the banks of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal. The interior, painted a curiously unwarlike peach colour, includes four floors of exhibits from the Royal Armouries' national collection, centred on the themes of war, tournaments, self defence, hunting and the Orient. Interpreters and interactive exhibits fill in the historical background and help put life into these instruments of death. The displays are modern and effective, and deserve credit for demonstrating the realities of war.  There are numerous demonstrations throughout the day (pick up a schedule when you arrive), and outside from Easter to October you can see displays of jousting and falconry in the Tiltyard. Perhaps the biggest controversy about the Armouries is that it is in Leeds at all; when on display at the Tower of London, the exhibits attracted many more visitors. The Royal Armouries is about fifteen minutes walk southeast of town, and is best reached by foot or bus. Admission is free.
