 Off the Beaten Track  Wasai Kandal, about 12km (7mi) south-west of BSB, is a forest area with waterfalls and pools. A wide, easy-to-follow path leads past picnic ponds and pools to Air Terjun Tinggi, the most impressive falls. A rough track takes you to Air Terjun Rendah, another waterfall with its own picnic area. You'll need a car to get here.
