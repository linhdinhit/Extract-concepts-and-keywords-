 Attractions  The National Museum of the country, often touted as the birthplace of humanity, is a great place to start exploring the Kenyans' cultural riches. It has exhibits on the material culture of the various Kenyan tribes. It also houses displays of rock art, fossils, the origins of humans and a bird gallery of 900 stuffed and mounted specimens. One of the major exhibits on show is the Peoples of Kenya portraits by Joy Adamson of Born Free fame. Opposite the museum is the interesting Snake Park, where the exhibits are of a decidedly more living nature. The museum is a leisurely 1km (0.6mi) stroll northwest of the city centre just across the Nairobi River.
