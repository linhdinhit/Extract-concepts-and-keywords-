 Off the Beaten Track  This is the town that gave its name to the well-known fabric design of swirling stylised teardrops or pinecones called the Paisley Pattern. Now really a suburb west of Glasgow, Paisley grew up around the abbey. By the 19th century, the town was a major producer of printed cotton and woollen cloth. The famous design was, in fact, copied from shawls brought back from India. At one time, Paisley was the largest producer of cotton thread in the world; the Coats family of threadmakers have enjoyed a long association with the town.  Here you will find Paisley Abbey, in Abbey Close, which was founded in 1163 by Walter Fitzallan, the first High Steward of Scotland and ancestor of the Stuart dynasty. On the other side of Abbey Close you will see the grand Town Hal. At the western end of the High St, there's the University of Paisley and the Museum and Art Gallery, with a large display of Paisley shawls and an interesting outline of the history of the Paisley Pattern. It also has collections of local and natural history, ceramics, and 19th century Scottish art. The Coats Observatory has interesting displays about astronomy, earthquake recording, and weather and climate, all continuously monitored here since 1882.
