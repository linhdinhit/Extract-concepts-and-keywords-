 Attractions  Milano's navel, Piazza del Duomo, has the atmosphere of London's Piccadilly Circus and much more interesting architecture. The cathedral was commissioned in 1386 and is the world's fourth-largest church. The late-Gothic wonder features a forest of spires and statuary, marble pinnacles and pillars, all woven together with a web of flying buttresses. A gilded copper statue of the Madonna rises above the myriad vertices, distracting awed observers from the church's most interesting omission: The duomo has no bell tower.  The duomo's finest relic is a nail purportedly used to pin Jesus to a cross all those years ago. Every September, the Archbishop of Milan retrieves the sacred bit of metal from its perch high above the nave and presents it to an adoring (or at least curious) congregation.  The neighboring Museo del Duomo chronicles the church's six centuries and displays an interesting collection of art and artifacts.
