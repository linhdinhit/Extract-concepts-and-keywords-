 Environment  Guinea is slightly larger than Britain, and you can get a handle on its geography by dividing it into four zones: the coastal plain (with Conakry on a peninsula thrusting out to the south-west); the north-western Fouta Djalon hill region (source of most of the Niger River); the northern dry lowlands; and the hilly, forested area of the south-east. Shaped like a boot sitting on its toe, Guinea basks on the shores of the equatorial North Atlantic near the bottom of the bulge of West Africa. Its neighbours are Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Liberia, Mali, C te d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone, and it has 320km (198mi) of Atlantic coastline.  Guinea has no national parks; the forest elephants and other fauna have fended badly against poachers and loss of habitat through logging and the spread of cultivation. The eastern part of the country is heavily vegetated, although it is far from virgin forest because of fires and farming. The improving road system is a boon for travellers wanting to move around the country, but not so good for the forests as timber is now much more accessible than it was in the past.  Guinea is one of the wettest countries in West Africa, and May to October is the rainy season. Conakry receives over 4m (13ft) of rain a year, but the centre of the country receives less than half that. The cool weather falls between November and February, and from December to February the harmattan winds blow in from the Sahara and the skies of Guinea - and most of West Africa - are flushed with grey sand. On these mothers of all bad hair days, visibility can be reduced to 1km (0.6mi).
