 Activities  Few venture to the Zanzibar Archipelago without whetting their appetite for goggling at pristine coral reefs up close. Diving and snorkelling around Zanzibar, Pemba and the smaller islands is among the best in the world. For those still feeling dust-clogged after weeks on the road, languishing on one of the many beaches for a few days is a fine antidote.  When your olfactory senses tire of all things fishy, take a spice tour to bamboozle the senses. The archipelago still produces cloves, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, breadfruit, jackfruit, vanilla and lemongrass. Those interested in architecture will enjoy meandering around old Stone Town, admiring the Arabic, African and colonial buildings. And if you're keen to swot up on Swahili, language courses are held in Zanzibar Town, the very area from which the language originated.
