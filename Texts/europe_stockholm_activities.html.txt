 Activities  Stockholm offers a great variety of activities for its taxpayers, and prices are subsidised. In summer, many people head for the coast and the islands with good swimming spots, or go picnicking in the parks. There are also indoor/open-air pools in the far south of Södermalm.  Wwith all this water about, why not try boating, either of the sail or motor variety. There are also rentals available for those who prefer kayaking or canoeing   Cycling is best in parks and away from the busy central streets and arterial roads, but some streets have special cycle lanes (often shared with pedestrians). Tourist offices can supply maps of cycle routes.
