 Activities  With all those lakes right in Hamburg's city centre, you won't be disappointed with boating opportunities; there are pedal, sail, row and even steam boats, all offering a great way to see the port. The city's flat topography makes for great cycling, especially along the paved paths around the Outer Alster, which is also good for in-line skating and walking.  Just a few hours drive from Hamburg, the Harz Mountains are known for their cross-country skiing and ski hikes, although resorts such as Braunlage, Hahnenklee and St Andreasberg also offer good downhill skiing. In summer the Harz Mountains are a centre for hiking, with short trails around the area; some have traditional restaurants along the way - a boon for hungry hikers.
