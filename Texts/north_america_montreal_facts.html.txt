 When to Go  Montreal has a notoriously arctic winter (December-March) that makes it great as a base for winter sports, but with the sort of spiteful temperatures that would probably frighten a polar bear. Thankfully, Montreal gets around the problem with its 'Underground City', a unique climate-controlled labyrinthe of 2000 shops and 29km (18mi) of corridors. This makes the city an alluring year-round tourist drawcard - a winter wonderland during the cold season and warm, long, lazy nights in the summer. Late May to early September is peak tourist time and sees a seamless procession of festivals, including the legendary Jazz Festival and the Grand Prix, take over the town.     Events  It's no surprise that a city proud of its art and cultural heritage has no shortage of entertainment and celebrations. The Montreal Jazz Festival is perhaps the city's most famous fixture, with jazz legends from far and wide playing for the discerning and appreciative Montrealers from late June until early July. At the other end of the serenity scale, the Canadian Grand Prix, held in early June on Montreal's le Notre Dame, is a major drawcard for speed freaks.  In what has become a hugely popular and all-welcoming event, Montreal's gay scene shakes its booty during the first week of August - Gay & Lesbian Pride Week, where almost anything goes. Gaining increasing reputations worldwide for unearthing new talent are the Fringe Festival, the Just For Laughs Festival and the Montreal International Film Festival. To top it all off with the biggest of bangs, the Montreal International Fireworks Competition from late-June until late July is a prestigious pyrotechnic pow-wow drawing oohs and aahs from gaping audiences on the banks of St Lawrence River.
