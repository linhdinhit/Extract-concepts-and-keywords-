 When to Go  San Diego has an all-but-perfect climate, so weather-wise any time is a good time to visit. If you want to indulge in watersports and bake yourself on the beach, it's best to come between May and October, when average daily highs range from 70 to 85 F (22 to 30 C). Even in the coolest months (December and January), daily high temperatures still hover pleasantly close to 68 F (20 C). Surfing is always good, but the best conditions are from September to November, with strong swells and offshore Santa Ana winds. Gray whales head south past Point Loma from mid-December to late February and return on their way north in March.     Events  It's not all sunshine and surf in San Diego, as the Ocean Beach Kite Festival makes the most of the wind with kite making, decorating and flying competitions in March. American Indian Cultural Days held in Balboa Park in May includes Native American dancing, music and art exhibits. Things get a little more raunchy at the Pacific Beach Block Party held on Garnet Ave the same month.  The Ocean Beach Street Fair and Chili Cook-Off is a popular two-day street bash in June. It's accompanied that month by the three-week Del Mar Fair, a huge county fair held at the Del Mar Fairgrounds with headline musical acts and hundreds of carnival rides.  The Hillcrest City Fest street fair is held in one of San Diego's liveliest innercity areas in August. The Gaslamp Quarter gets in one the neighborhood party scene in September during the San Diego Street Scene festival. The Harbor Parade of Lights in December goes one better than a Christmas tree, with dozens of decorated illuminated boats floating in San Diego's harbor.
