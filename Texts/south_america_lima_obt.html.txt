 Off the Beaten Track  This site, about 40km (25mi) south-east of Lima, was considered one of the most important religious monuments by the indigenous people of the central Andes. The primary architectural unit is the walled enclosure containing a stepped pyramid, storage structures and patios. The site was built around two perpendicular avenues, which cross one another at the centre of the site. Numerous Huari-influenced designs appear on the ceramics and textiles of Pachacamac's large cemetery. At the height of its powers Pachacamac covered around 85 hectares. Most of the site's architectural compounds and pyramids were constructed from around 800CE to 1450. Following the expansion of the Inca empire, Pachacamac became an important Inca administrative centre, while maintaining its status as a religious shrine. The Incas built five separate complexes there, including the Pyramid of the Sun and the Mamacuna. The latter contains fine Inca masonry in its entrance gate, a rarity on the coast. The site's name derives from the Quechua term for the coastal deity, Pacha Camac ('he who vitalises the universe'). The main temple at the site was dedicated to this deity and held a famous oracle. Pilgrims travelled to the centre from great distances, and its cemetery was considered sacrosanct. The site of Pachacamac has been preserved, and one of the Inca structures, the Mamacuna, has been reconstructed. A must-see for architecture and archaeology buffs.
