 Activities   Wildlife watching is the Falkland Islands' main attraction. Though the islands' many birds and marine mammals are relatively tame, observers should keep a conscientious distance. Penguins are the most famous residents, with five species breeding regularly on the islands' beaches, headlands and estuaries. Also, look for large colonies of beautiful black-browed albatrosses, crested caracaras, cormorants, falcons, hawks and swans, as well as elephant seals, sea lions, dolphins and killer whales.   Trekking is a good option, though many landowners and the tourist board now discourage camping because of the fire danger and disturbance of stock and wildlife. The stretch from Seal Bay to Volunteer Point on the northern coast of East Falkland offers a magnificent mixture of broad sandy beaches and rugged headlands with penguins always in view. And if hiking the route is not your thing, you can always arrange horseback riding in Stanley.   Fishing for sea trout, mullet and smelt is another popular pastime, especially at the Murrell River, within walking distance of Stanley. There are many other suitable places in camp, as well as deep-sea fishing from launches across the islands. Fishing season runs from September through April, with March and April the best months for hooking trout.   Windsurfing is possible in sheltered waters such as Stanley Harbour, but only the truly adept can avoid being swept off to South Africa on the prevailing winds. Experienced scuba divers may enjoy exploring the islands' many shipwrecks. Wet suits are essential for any water sports aside from swimming in Stanley's public pool.
