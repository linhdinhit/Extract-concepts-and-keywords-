 Attractions  The row of beautiful sandstone warehouses on the harbourfront at Salamanca Place is a prime example of Australian colonial architecture. Dating back to the whaling days of the 1830s, these warehouses were the centre of Hobart Town's trade and commerce. Today they have been tastefully developed (if you like that sort of thing) to house galleries, restaurants, nightspots and shops selling everything from vegetables to antiques. An open-air market is held at Salamanca Place every Saturday morning.
