 Activities  Cape Town's range of activities together constitute an outdoor thrill seeker's charter. The boom in backpacker accommodation has triggered a boom in organized adventure activities. Abseiling (rappelling) off Table Mountain and Chapman's Peak are very popular. Mountain biking is booming as trails are being developed in many local parks and reserves. Local currents create a wide variety of diving conditions, which are best between June and November. Cage diving for a close-up look at great white sharks is not for the timid. Kloofing is Afrikaans for spelunking and involves climbing, walking, swimming and jumping around in kloofs (cliffs or gorges). The Cape Peninsula has fantastic surfing possibilities for all skill levels. Other sporty options include canoeing, white-water rafting, kayaking, sandboarding and windsurfing. Simply walking around the peninsula's many trails is a great workout. Finally, a harbor cruise on Table Bay should not be missed.
