 Activities  San Franciscans are an energetic lot, and there are plenty of opportunities to burn calories even within the city limits. A glance over the sail-dotted bay would suggest this is prime sailing and windsurfing country, but it's not the easiest stretch of water to navigate, and much of the year the wind can be as chilly as going the full dunk. None of the 'California girl' visions apply to San Francisco: ocean swimming is never very pleasant, and the treacherous surf at Ocean Beach is only for the hardy. Walking and sunbathing are the most popular waterside activities. Jogging is also popular beachside and in the city's parks. In-line skating and cycling rule supreme in Golden Gate Park, where you can also play just about any sport you can think of - anyone for petanque?
