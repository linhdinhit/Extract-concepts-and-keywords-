 Attractions  Yaren is understandably low on most travellers' agendas, but the beaches aren't far away, and neither is the open ocean if you're planning a deep-sea fishing trip. You can while away a few minutes by looking at the two Japanese guns and the numerous bunkers and pillboxes left after WWII. You could also walk around the machinery dump, or sit in your hotel room and watch Television New Zealand. The hotel does have a bar, casino, shopping and a restaurant serving Thai, Chinese and Indian food. For conference junkies, there's a conference room that seats 200 people.
