 Off the Beaten Track  Etang-Sale-les-Bains is the beginning of the holiday coast, though the area remains very much an agricultural community. On weekends, the black-sand beach is much quieter than the coast further north around St-Gilles-les-Bains. The town itself is sheltered by a coral reef which, with extreme caution, is accessible on foot at low tide. Near town is a 2ha (5ac) bird park operated by the Office National des For ts.
