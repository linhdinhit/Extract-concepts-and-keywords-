 Attractions  It's pushing the definition to label Gaborone an attraction, but as you'll probably have to pass through here on your way to someplace more attractive, it's worth knowing a little about Botswana's capital. The first thing to know is that it's not somewhere you'll want to linger - distances in Gaborone are long and uninteresting, there's heavy traffic, no footpaths and the city is a mess of suburbs and highrises. And as there's no central business district, the action tends to gravitate to suburban malls. If Los Angeles without the glitz sounds like your cup of tea, visit Gaborone.  Gaborone's premier attraction is the National Museum & Art Gallery, offering the usual collection of historic artefacts and stuffed animals. The museum's displays of San culture thoroughly cover the desert dwellers, while other ethnographic installations provide background on Botswana's diverse cultural groups. The small national gallery is a repository for both traditional and modern African and European pieces, including some San artwork.  The Gaborone Game Reserve is designed for those who want a safari to go. About a kilometre outside Gaborone, the reserve is really just a bunch of antelopes and a fenced-in white rhino. If you'd rather do your range roving au naturel, you can take a horseback safari into the scrubby bush north-west of Gaborone. There are several places to stay in Gaborone, but very few budget options. Gaborone lies midway along Botswana's south-eastern border with South Africa.
