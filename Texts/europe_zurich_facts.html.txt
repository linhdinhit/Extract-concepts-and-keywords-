 When to Go  You can visit Switzerland any time throughout the year. Summer lasts roughly from June to September and offers the most pleasant climate for outdoor pursuits. Unfortunately, you won't be the only tourist during this period, so prices can be high and accommodation hard to find. You'll find much better deals and fewer crowds in the shoulder seasons of April to May and late-September to October. In the winter months, Zürich receives little snow and few tourists, but it's a pleasant stop-off point for relaxing or shopping after a trip to mountain resorts.     Events  The city shakes off any remains of winter with the spring festival and parade, Sechseläuten, held on the third Monday of April. During the Züri Fäscht, held once every three years at the start of July (the next one is July 2-4, 2004), a huge fairground takes over central Zürich, topped off with a lavish fireworks display. The Zürcher festspiele, mid-June to mid-July, concentrates on music and the arts, while the emphasis of the month-long Theaterspektakel is, you guessed it, theater. In early August, the beats get going with Street Parade, a large-scale electronic music event with international DJs on the decks, and the Züri Jazz Woche takes over the stage in early September. In November, Expovina, held on boats on the Bürkliplatz, offers samples of international wines, and Fasnacht brings lively musicians and a large, costumed procession.
