 Off the Beaten Track  Heading south from Memphis, as soon as you cross the state line you'll see cotton fields stretching to the horizon, dotted with cabins, tractors and cypress swamps. This is the Mississippi Delta, and Clarksdale is in the heart of it. Birthplace of Sam Cooke, Son House, Jackie Brentson and Little Junior Parker, Clarksdale was also the childhood home of playwright Tennessee Williams. A must-see for blues enthusiasts is the Delta Blues Museum, where modest but informative exhibits cover the history of many forms of African-American music, from field hollers to hip-hop. You can get records of the music and books on its history at the museum store.  You can pick up records by local blues musicians at Rooster Records, located in an old steamboat shack. Rooster also sells its own Delta Blues Map Kit, as well as red flannel mojo bags and roots to get your mojo workin'. Fans of the Empress of the Blues, Bessie Smith, can see the Riverside Hotel (now a run-down boarding house), where Smith died following a car crash in 1937. Her grave went unmarked for decades until Janis Joplin bought a stone for it.  Clarksdale is about 70mi (110km) southwest of Memphis. Greyhound buses run daily between the two.
