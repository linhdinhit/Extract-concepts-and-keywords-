 Off the Beaten Track  The village of Jokkmokk (D lvaddis in Samish), just north of the Arctic Circle, started as a Sami market and mission, and is now a centre of revitalised Sami culture. The Sami winter fair takes place the first three days from the first Thursday in February, when you can shop seriously for handicrafts (S mi duodji) worked in the traditional bold blue, red and yellow. There's a museum here with excellent information on the mountainous interior, should you be thinking of plunging further north, and a restaurant which does a nice line in reindeer sandwiches.  Jokkmokk is a good place to come and see the midnight sun, but don't let your enthusiasm outdo your eyesight: the sun is always dangerous to look at. Summer visitors who are particularly brave pretend to enjoy a bracing dip in the river; the more sensible stick to dangling trout lines in Jokkmokk's central lake. Jokkmokk is relatively isolated, and you should book accommodation well in advance if arriving at winter fair time. Public transport access is via the Inlandsbanan rail connection: get off at nearby Malmbanan and take the bus.
