 Attractions  T rshavn is high on picturesque charm but low on much action of any kind, so if you're looking to party you'll be disappointed. But a stroll around Tinganes, the small peninsula where the town began a thousand years ago, is enough to endear it to just about anyone. It has narrow streets and is very busy, conjuring up the heyday of 'wonderful Copenhagen' at the height of its maritime trade. The modern town centre is focused on the area between Tinganes and Wintersgøta, just up the hill from the harbours on either side of the peninsula. On the far end of Tinganes stands Skansapakk si, an impressive building that once served as an artillery depot. During the war with Britain in 1808, the British emptied it and threatened to destroy T rshavn if the town did not surrender.   Munkastovan is a heavy stone-walled former monastery, built in the 15th century and one of the few buildings to escape a devastating fire in 1673. The other building to escape the flames was Leigub in, the king's storehouse, where agricultural goods paid as taxes were stored before shipping to the mainland.  The most impressive museum in town is probably the Historical Museum. It displays religious and maritime artefacts, boats, and household, fishing, navigation and farming implements from the Viking age to the present. Nordic House is an architecturally interesting building with a turf roof, and its interior is used as a theatre and a conference, concert and exhibition hall. It houses visiting exhibitions from around Scandinavia, and has a library and cafeteria. On Tuesday nights in summer, it hosts 'Faroese evenings' for tourists. On the northern edge of Vi arlin Park is Listask lin, the Faroese Museum of Art, with a fine collection of works by Faroese painters and sculptors. The museum also hosts theatrical and musical performances and special exhibitions.
