As a general rule, however, you might find your Polynesian parade being rained on in December and January and your holiday smile melting in the humid months between November and April. The very best time to go is in the dry season, between May and October, when the weather is perfect and the events calendar is full. If you're a keen diver or into big-game fishing, the Polynesian Dive Fest and the Game Fishing Tournament take place in mid-August. The rising of the Palolo, one of the most fascinating natural phenomena, takes place on the coral reefs of Savai'i in October and the Samoan cultural event of the year, the Teuila Festival, takes place in September.     Events  The biggest cultural event in independent Samoa is the Teuila Festival in September, featuring choir singing, fire-knife dancing, siva (traditional dance), and fautasi (longboat) racing. A month before the Teuila Festival is the Polynesian Dive Fest which provides an opportunity for both professional and amateur divers to explore some of Samoa's best dive sites. One of the most spectacular natural phenomena is the rising of the Palolo. Palolo are bluey-green vermicelli-shaped worms that emerge from the coral reefs, sometime after midnight on the seventh day after a full moon, to mate. The first rising takes place in October and the second one around November.
