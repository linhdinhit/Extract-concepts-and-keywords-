 Off the Beaten Track  The gold lotus domes of the Self Realization Fellowship, founded by Yogi Paramahansa Yoganada in 1937, are conspicuous on the coastal bluff at Encinitas. Live-in retreats are available for those in need of spiritual renewal, but if you just need a quick refresher the meditation gardens are open to the public. The beach below the bluff is called Swami's, and it has one of the best big breaks for experienced surfers. Commercial flower farms occupy the range inland, and in spring they coat the hills in spectacular bands of brilliant color. Encinitas' Quail Botanical Gardens have a large collection of California native plants and flora from Central America and Australia.  Encinitas is approximately 22 miles (35km) north of San Diego, just off I-5. It's accessible from San Diego by local bus, Greyhound and commuter train.
