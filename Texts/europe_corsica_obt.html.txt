 Off the Beaten Track  Here's an attraction that is not so much off the beaten track, as very much on the beaten (walking) track. The GR20 walking track is famous, with 10,000 brave souls tramping its signposted route each year. The trail follows a diagonal route from northwest to southeast along the island's continental divide. Around 200km (124mi) long, it is divided into 15 stages of five to eight hours' walking each. It cuts through the Parc Naturel Regional de Corse, traversing spectacular wilderness scenery at average altitudes of 1000-2000m (3280-6560ft). If you take up the challenge, you'll pass through deep forests of laricio pine and beech, along granite moonscapes, windswept craters, glacial lakes, torrents, peat bogs, maquis, snow-capped peaks, plains and stretches of frozen snow called neves.  Nature lovers will be delighted, as will those in search of tranquility, although it can get busy. There are refuges (mountain shelters), bergeries (shepherd's huts) and camping facilities along the way. Most people take a few detours down into villages, soaking up the culture and some decent food without a backpack. It has to be said that the GR20 is a walk that requires real stamina and commitment: the path is rocky, the weather conditions difficult and you have to be able to carry enough supplies for a few days. If you want to take this one on, do some training first! June and September, just before and after the high season, are the best times to go.
