 When to Go  Given the extremes of New England weather - hot, humid summers (June to August) and chilly, wet winters (November to February) - the best times to visit Boston are late spring (April to May) and early fall (September to October). Bear in mind that thousands of college students start their school year in late August and early September - and there are over 50 college campuses in the greater Boston area.     Events  Kick off the Chinese New Year in February with firecrackers and scampering dragons. If you've ever had a taste for green beer you can drink your fill on St Patrick's Day in mid-March. South Boston holds the city's biggest St Paddy's parade, though Cambridge has made a point of allowing the gay and lesbian groups that SoBo excludes to march. The city streets resound with the muffled slaps of thousands of racing shoes during April's Boston Marathon.   Harborfest is Boston's week-long version of the Fourth of July, with a free Boston Pops concert on the Esplanade and fireworks over the harbor. Save some room for July's Chowderfest, when you can sample dozens of fish and clam chowders from some of Boston's best restaurants. Head over to Cambridge for the Christmas Revels, which features music, dancing and theater from a different folkloric tradition each December.
