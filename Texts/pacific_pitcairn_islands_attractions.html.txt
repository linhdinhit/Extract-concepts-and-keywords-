 Attractions  Adamstown sits at the top of the appropriately named Hill of Difficulty, perched 120m (394ft) above the sea. Houses are either 'upside' or 'downside' of the main road. The public square is the heart of the island, and buildings around it serve as a courthouse, island magistrate's office, community hall, church, dispensary, library and post office. Among the many reminders of the island's origins are Fletcher Christian's Bounty Bible, kept in a glass case in the church. It was raffled off in 1839 but returned to the island in 1949. The Bounty's anchor, salvaged by a National Geographic team, stands outside the court house, and there's a Bounty cannon further down the road.
