 Off the Beaten Track  Not as off the beaten track as the name might suggest, this huge complex is located, sans ice, near the airport. Christchurch has been the base for the USA's Antarctic programs since the 1950s, and this is also where the New Zealand and Italian operations are administered. Visitors can experience Antarctic-type stuff such as being very cold (dubbed the 'Snow and Ice Experience', where you can explore a sub-zero snow cave and slide down a tunnel swept by freezing winds) and rides on a Hägglund Snowmobile. It's all very well presented and hands-on, with the added bonus that most of the staff have lived and worked on the great southern continent. You can reach the centre by airport bus.
