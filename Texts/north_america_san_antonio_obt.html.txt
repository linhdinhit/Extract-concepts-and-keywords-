 Off the Beaten Track  A trip to Laredo is the closest thing to a Mexican vacation a San Antonian can take without actually leaving Texas. Bisected neatly by the mighty Rio Grande - the dividing line between Texas and Mexico - Laredo and its south of the border hermanita, Nuevo Laredo, are together known as Los Dos Laredos (the Two Laredos), and the two cities make up the most lively fiesta zone the hinterlands have to offer. And whether it's the anniversary of the Mexican Revolution or George Washington's birthday, the fun is shared by all.  Laredo holds the distinction of being the only Spanish settlement in the Lone Star State with its earliest roots neither in guns nor crosses. Of course, rural hamletdom didn't last long, and today it has a bevy of antique churches, forts and museum pieces to show us why. Still, the town's main attractions are its Texican traditions and its (literal) bridging of US/Mexican cultures. The border-spanning International Bridge No 1 across the Rio Grande (known to Mexicans as the Rio Bravo) is walkable in five minutes with minimal formalities, and there's a great market just four blocks beyond. And monolingual gringos can relax as both languages are spoken by just about everyone on both sides of the border.  Laredo is 152mi (245km) and a bit over two hours drive southwest of San Antonio along I-35. Greyhound buses make the trip daily, as do flights from SAT into Laredo International Airport.
