Stockholm's coastal archipelago ( skärgård) consists of at least 24,000 islands and is served by one of the largest antique steamer fleets anywhere in Europe.  Ecological consciousness is high and reflected in concern for native animals, clean water and renewable resources. The Swedish government strictly enforces its anti-pollution laws. Fishing in clean waters surrounding central Stockholm isn't unusual.
