 Activities  For a full list of Prague's sports halls and complexes, pick up a copy of Welcome to Prague or Prague This Month, available at many tourist offices.  For folks visiting Prague in the warmer months, there are plenty of outdoor activities. Whether you stroll through the greenbelt atop Petrin Hill or rent a bicycle to test the cobblestones downtown, you can always mix sightseeing with exercise. An even more interesting option might be renting a rowboat or pedal-boat to tour the Vlatava River on your own power.  Other ways to sweat it out in the rarified Czech sunshine include swimnming in outdoor Olympic-sized swimming pools, and playing tennis, squash and golf. There is also horseback riding or the Prague International Marathon, which usually runs in late May. In the winter, several parks open ice-skating rinks.  And if the weather doesn't suit your tastes, there are always fitness centers (check at larger hotels), indoor pools, and many other indoor options, such as bowling and billiards.
