 Attractions  On Guadalcanal there are a range of natural attractions, in addition to points of interest in the capital, Honiara. Many visitors report that their first impression of Honiara is of a dusty, uneventful town. With diving tours, cruises and WWII sightseeing outings all departing from the capital, there is a sense of bustle that may only become apparent after time spent in the villages. When the tourists have set off for their day of sightseeing, you can browse the handicraft shops, or enjoy the cafes, restaurants and bars.   Point Cruz is the local travel hub of Honiara. Reputedly the point where Spanish explorer Menda a raised a cross, it is now the place where copra boats and passenger ferries load and unload passengers, and is alway busy and colourful. Also of interest are the Parliament, National Museum and Cultural Centre, Botanical Gardens, the nearby Water Pump Village and the colourful, vibrant Chinatown.
