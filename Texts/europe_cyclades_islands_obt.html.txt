 Off the Beaten Track  It may be tiny, but Delos is one of the most important archaeological sites in Greece. The sacred island is the mythical birthplace of famous twins Apollo and Artemis, and it developed as a centre of Apollo worship in the 8th century BC. During Hellenistic times it was one of the three most important religious centres in Greece, and became populated by wealthy merchants and bankers. Most of the significant historical finds from the island are in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, but the site museum does have a modest collection, including the originals of the much-photographed plaster-cast lions that grace the Terrace of the Lions near the Sanctuary of Apollo. If you're feeling spry, climb up 113m (371ft) Mt Kythnos to get a terrific overview of Delos. The pathway is reached by walking through the Theatre Quarter, where Delos' wealthy built their houses.  You can't stay overnight on Delos, and excursion boats from nearby Mykonos allow visitors a maximum of only six hours exploring time. Bring food and water - there is a cafeteria on Delos, but it's not recommended.
