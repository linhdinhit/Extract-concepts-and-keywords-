 Activities  South Korea is very much a get-out-in-the-open-air-and-exert-yourself destination. The mountains, national parks and rugged islands all lend themselves to hiking and mountain biking, although wherever you go there will be plenty of other people with the same idea. There are also a few good mountains for skiing - try Yongpyong on the east coast or the Alps Ski Resort near Seoraksan National Park. The season is from December to March. If golf is your game, South Korea has what you're after. There are over 60 courses throughout the country, but keep in mind that some of them have been created at the expense of beautiful natural landscapes. Indoor activities are also popular in South Korea - try your hand at billiards, hot spring soaking or taekwondo, the national martial art.  During Seokcheonje (held in March and September), crowds gather at Confucian shrines to hear traditional court orchestras and watch costumed rituals. The best place to see this ceremony is at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. Lantern parades are held for Buddha's Birthday, celebrated in late April or early May. The most important of Korea's lunar holidays is the Harvest Moon Festival, which falls in early September. Cities throughout the country empty as people return to their family homes to pay homage to their ancestors. Around September the National Folk Arts Festival showcases Korean culture.
