 Activities  Brussels offers plenty of options for visitors who have overindulged in fine chocolate and need to lose a few kilos. There are excellent jogging routes through beautiful greenways such as Parc de Bruxelles and Parc du Cinquantenaire, as well as a dozen public pools for swimming. Among the many golf courses in and around Brussels, the 18-hole Royal Amicale Golf Club is a standout. Cycling in Brussels isn't for the faint-hearted, although there are some bike lanes around.  Come winter, head to the Grand Place to experience one of the world's most picturesque ice skating rinks, set up for just a few weeks in December. The hilly Ardennes in southeastern Belgium are the country's winter playground; cross-country skiing is the main attraction.  There are also indoor activities available in town, from gyms to courts set aside for squash and tennis. And, if you're feeling more cerebral, you can head to Le Greenwich, an Old World cafe known for its no-holds-barred chess tournaments.
