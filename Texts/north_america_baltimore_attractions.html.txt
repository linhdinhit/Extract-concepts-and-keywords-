 Attractions  The Inner Harbor is the revitalized heart of Baltimore. It encompasses both the head of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River and the land around it. Now a major tourist attraction, it includes a waterfront promenade, museums, tour boats, historic ships, and the innovative National Aquarium. Over 5000 marine animals are housed in the aquarium's two glass pyramids; an elevator takes you to the top and you walk down ramps that spiral around large circular tanks. The Baltimore Maritime Museum is housed in a ship and submarine docked on the western side of the aquarium and includes the USS Torsk, the last submarine to sink a Japanese ship during WWII. On the northern side of the harbor is the World Trade Center, designed by IM Pei to be the world's tallest pentagonal structure. There's a good view of Baltimore from the 27th floor.
