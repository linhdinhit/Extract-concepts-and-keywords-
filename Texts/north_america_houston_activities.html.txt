 Activities  Memorial Park and Hermann Park are the two main areas in the city for walking and running. If your heat tolerance is less than a lizard's, the huge oak trees of Main Street provide deep shade over the wide sidewalks. If you get too cooked, you can go ice skating at the Galleria Mall, a few miles west of downtown.  There's great cycling along Houston's many park trails, and the area's flat topography makes for easy pedaling - though in summer just sitting still can be trying. Run your own time trials on the banked track at the Alkek Velodrome, built in 1986 as a training track for the US Olympic cycling team. The open-air facility is in Cullen Park, 20 miles (32km) west of downtown.
