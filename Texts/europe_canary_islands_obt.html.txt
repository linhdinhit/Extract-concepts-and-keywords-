 Off the Beaten Track  El Hierro is about as far as you can get from the tourist hordes, bars, international restaurants and oil-streaked, cavorting naked Swedes. It is a rural island largely untouched by tourism, and the green farmland divided by rough stone walls is more reminiscent of the Irish countryside than a subtropical beach resort. The capital is Valverde, the only Canaries capital not on the coast, and it's a lovely, red-roofed town of about 1600. The walking is good on the island, and you can pass through hamlets such as Echedo, in the heart of wine growing territory, or the cheese producing village of Isora. In the damp and misty centre, some of the towns have been deserted, but a few herdsmen still run small flocks of sheep, goats and some cattle.  You can fly to the island from Tenerife and Gran Canaria, and there are also frequent ferries. El Hierro is about 245km (152mi) west of Las Palmas.
