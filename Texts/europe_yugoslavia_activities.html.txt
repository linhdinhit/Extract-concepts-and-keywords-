 Activities  With plenty of mountains and a long, cold winter, Yugoslavs' thoughts frequently turn to snow. Serbia's largest centre for skiing is Kopaonik, which has 26 runs covering a total of 54km, and a 150-bed hostel. Brezovica, on the north side of the Sar Planina which separates Kosovo from Macedonia, is Kosovo's major resort. In Montenegro, try Zabljak. The ski season lasts from December to March. Yugoslavia also has some top spots for white-water rafting: try the Tara River in Durmitor National Park. Durmitor also has great skiing and hiking.
