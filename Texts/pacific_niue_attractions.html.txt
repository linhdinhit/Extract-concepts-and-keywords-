 Attractions  Niue's capital is little more than just one long street stretching for several kilometres along the rocky coastline. The waterline is marked by several traditional canoe-landing spots, including Opaahi Landing, the place where Captain Cook made an unsuccessful attempt to come ashore in 1744. There are a couple of pocket-handkerchief sized beaches, notably at Utuko and Omahi. The biggest attractions for divers lie directly offshore - the Chimney, Opaahi and Faka Laina (aka the Toilet Bowl) dives. A drop down into the crystal-clear depths is rewarded by a twisting series of gullies, ravines, chasms, caves and reef ridges. If bad weather hits, head indoors to learn the story of the island's history and culture at the Huanaki Cultural Centre, or visit the Ekalesia Church on Tomb Point. The two headstones outside the church mark the graves of two island kings, Tuitoga (ruled 1876-87) and Fataaiki (1888-96).
