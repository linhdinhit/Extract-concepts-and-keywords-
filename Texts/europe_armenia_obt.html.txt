 Off the Beaten Track  The hill resort of Dilizhan is the source of much of Armenia's mineral water, and the Regional Museum at ulitsa Myasnikyana, the main street, is worth a visit. The many furniture and carpet factories in Dilizhan today make great shopping, and you can tour the ruins of two 13th-century monasteries (Matosavank and Djukhtakvank) facing each other on opposite sides of a ravine. Armenians say that heaven must be like Dilizhan, and while that may be an exaggeration, it is a beautiful mountainous area with woods and springs. Agartsin Gorge and the Agartsin Monastery (which is 1000 years old) are particularly worth visiting in autumn. The monastery was probably the most important medieval Armenian cultural centre, and is a classic of Armenian architecture. A spa centre is nearby at Arzni. Dilizhan lies beyond the 2114m (6934ft) Sevan Pass, and is 120km (74.4mi) north-east by bus from Yerevan.
