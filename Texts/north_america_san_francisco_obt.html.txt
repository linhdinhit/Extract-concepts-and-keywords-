 Off the Beaten Track  Across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, Marin County is wealthy, laid back and right in tune with every trend that comes by. From hot tubs and cocaine to New Age spiritualism, mountain biking and designer pizzas, Marin was there first. It's a wonderfully varied peninsula with fiercely expensive Sausalito on the bay side and the wild Pacific coastline stretching north to popular Stinson Beach, hideaway Bolinas and fog-swept Point Reyes National Seashore, which is the best spot in the Bay Area for whale watching.  Between bay and ocean, the central hills rise to the 2600ft (770m) peak of Mt Tamalpais, overlooking the redwood stand of Muir Woods. The view from Mt Tam is a breathtaking 360 panorama of ocean, bay, cities, bridges and hills. Over 200mi (320km) of hiking and biking trails wind around the mountain, and deer, fox, bobcat and even the occasional mountain lion dwell in the forests and dells.  You're in Marin once you're over the Golden Gate Bridge: Highway 101 cuts directly through the region; Highway 1 branches off at Mill Valley and heads to the coast. Plenty of buses run from San Francisco; there are also ferries from Fisherman's Wharf to Sausalito, Larkspur and Tiburon.
