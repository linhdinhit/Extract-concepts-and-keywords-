 When to Go  Though Italy has a predominantly Mediterranean climate, Milan's winters (December - February) qualify as brisk, with lows below freezing. The mountains shield the city from the worst of the Northern European winter, however.  Summer (May-Sept) can be hot and muggy. In August, most of the city heads to the beaches to escape the 30 C-plus (86 F-plus) heat; you'd do well to follow suit.     Events  Milan likes to celebrate both the spiritual and material worlds with equal gusto. Among the highlights of the former is the annual Festa della Nivola (Festival of the Nail), which takes place September 15-18 at the duomo (cathedral). The archbishop of Milan takes to the air in his own private deus ex machina to recover a nail, stored near the cathedral ceiling, that was purportedly hammered into Jesus a couple of millennia ago. Carnivale which livens up Milan the week before Ash Wednesday, is a combination of Christian reverence and secular revelry.  If you feel the need for speed, Milan has the raceway for you: The Monza Autodrome, 31km (15 miles) northeast of the city, hosts the Italian Grand Prix, where the top designers from Fiat, Jaguar and Ferrari show off their finest formula-one racers at an average speed of 250km/hr (150 mi/hr).
