 Attractions  If you're looking for the highlights of the city's culture all neatly organised into a string of galleries and museums, then the Art Mile is just the ticket. Hamburg Kunsthalle houses a collection that ranges from medieval portraiture to 20th-century minimalism. Many of the artworks survived the Nazis' destructive 1937 sweep in which many of Germany's art treasures disappeared.  The stark white cube housing Kunsthalle's contemporary collection is the Galerie der Gegenwart, three floors of modern art with the likes of Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman and David Hockney on display. If you're feeling arty or crafty, check out the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe. It houses sculpture, furniture, jewellery, musical instruments and an authentic Japanese teahouse that holds regular tea ceremonies.  The latest and greatest by Hamburg's local artists is showcased at Kunsthaus, while the Deichtorhallen hosts visiting exhibitions as well as the photography of Helmut Newton, Annie Leibowitz and other happy snappers.
