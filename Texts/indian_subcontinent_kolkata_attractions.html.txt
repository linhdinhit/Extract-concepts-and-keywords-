 Attractions  Often referred to as the 'lungs' of Kolkata, the Maidan is a huge green expanse of India's most scarce commodity - open space. Its most imposing feature is Fort William, which was rebuilt there in 1758 after the original fort was destroyed. Costing a fortune, it wasn't completed until 20 years later, the surrounding area having been cleared of jungle, creating the Maidan that so many enjoy today. The fort is still in official use and is off-limits to visitors.  In the northeastern section is Eden Gardens, which houses the famous Calcutta Cricket Ground (Ranji Stadium) - the atmosphere during international matches held here often reach hysterical proportions. In a recent match, following a famous Indian victory, the crowd seemed set to simulataneously combust as fans began lighting newspapers and waving them overhead. Less zealous are the grazing cows, musical fountains and early-morning yoga/meditation sessions also at home in the gardens. Just west of the gardens is a pleasant spot for walking or cruising along the Hooghly River. South of the Maidan is the well-established zoo and beyond that the peaceful Horticultural Gardens.
