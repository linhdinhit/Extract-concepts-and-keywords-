 Attractions  Nice's old town is a delightful mish-mash of winding streets, lively squares and Genoese, Proven al, medieval and baroque architecture, all overlooked by a 92m (300ft) hill known as Le Ch teau. The park atop the hill has spectacular views of the old town, the bay and the port with its pretty le-de-Beaute square bordered by ochre houses. Vieux Nice also has plenty of cafes and restaurants, and is a top spot in the evenings, with a swag of places to booze and boogie.  If you want to see Italian baroque churches, Saint-Martin-Saint-Augustin (the oldest church in Nice), Saint-Fran ois-de-Paule (baroque and classical), Saint-Giuame (also known as Saint-Jacques, l'Annonciation and Sainte-Rita) and the elegant Chapelle de la Misericorde should keep you busy. The cathedrale Sainte Reparate (1650-80) in the area's central square, place Rossetti, was built in honour of the city's patron saint; the steeple dates from the 18th century.   Palais Lascaris is a beautiful example of Genoese baroque architecture, featuring a sweeping staircase decorated with frescoes. It's also home to an 18th-century apothecary and a museum of local history. If you head past the palace towards the sea you hit the bustling cours Saleya, with its flower and vegetable market, and the Paillon gardens which separate the old and new towns. The belle epoque Opera is just off the cours Saleya.
