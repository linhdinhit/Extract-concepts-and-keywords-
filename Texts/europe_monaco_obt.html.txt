 Off the Beaten Track  Who would've thought cacti could be so much fun? With 7000 varieties of cacti and succulents, the Jardin Exotique is paradise for prickle-lovers. If 7000 cacti is about 6998 too many, the Jardin is still worth a visit for its spectacular views. The entry price also gets you into a cave complex packed full of stalagmites and stalactites, and the Musee d'Anthropologie Prehistorique, which tells the history of humanity through archaeological finds from the area.
