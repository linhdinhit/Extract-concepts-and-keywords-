 Off the Beaten Track  Avanersuaq lies in the realms of Ultima Thule, that most inaccessible of all lands at the northernmost region of the world. Its discovery worked overtime on the imaginations of armchair travellers and amateur anthropologists back in the Old World, and firsthand accounts of a land of glittering ice towers, hostile landscapes and a tribe of furred people bestowed upon Ultima Thule the kind of mythical proportions that only Shangri La and heaven could aspire to.  Even today Avanersuaq is difficult to reach, difficult to traverse and not cheap. Adding to its enigmatic quality are the regulations governing the movement of foreigners; tourists are not permitted into the district between 15 September and 15 April, and any foreigner visiting the Thule airbase requires a visitors pass issued by the US Air Attache, the Danish Ministry or the Danish embassy.  After you've had a look at the Knud Rasmussen Museum in Qaanaaq, there are very few human-made artefacts to hold your attention. The Thule District is for doing rather than looking; several spring dogsled tours are operational, as are eight-day trips between Qaanaaq and Siorapaluk. These trips include meals, seal and walrus-hunting and accommodation in cabins and igloos. However, the most challenging possibility is a 15-day hunting trip over the sea ice to several Avanersuaq villages.  Avanersuaq is over 1500km (930mi) north of Nuuk. The best way to get there is by plane; there are weekly flights from Kangerlussuaq. It is possible to get to the Thule District by ferry, but only if you luck out in a serious way. One boat does an annual run from Kangerlussuaq and Ilulissat to Qaanaq, normally in the first week of September when ice conditions are favourable.
