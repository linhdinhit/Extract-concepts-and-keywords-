 Off the Beaten Track  Henry Ford and 11 associates opened the Ford Motor Company in 1903 with US$28,000 in cash. They used the money to kick off their tiny operation in a converted Detroit wagon shop and employ 10 people. Today, Ford is the second largest car and truck maker in the world, and 370,000 people work for the company.  Ford was born and raised in Dearborn, a small town not far from Detroit. In 1915, he moved himself and parts of the company back to his home town and a decade and a half later opened the doors to this sprawling museum complex dedicated to the 'the spirit of innovation in America.' The museum remains much as Ford originally planned and is - surprise! - a massive shrine to the automobile and its impact on America. Here the cult and culture of the car is beaten to a pulp and the museum's grounds are congested with full-size highway billboards, fast food neon signs, a gas station, diner and other roadside attractions. The Wienermobile used in 1936 by Oscar Meyer hot dogs is a particular knockout.  The Henry Ford Museum is in Dearborn, 8 miles (12km) southwest of Detroit on Hwy 12. The SMART bus service can get you there, but you're better off driving yourself. It would make Henry proud.
