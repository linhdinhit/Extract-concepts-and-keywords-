 Activities  There isn't a huge range of organised activities in Chad. Just making it in and out is an all-consuming activity that leaves little time or energy for parasailing or bungee jumping. The mountains in the north would be a challenging climb for the adventurous if they weren't off-limits due to possible guerilla activity and the less than welcoming locals. There is one rocky outcrop good for climbing - though not commonly used for this purpose - on the eastern shore of Lac Chad at Hadjer al Hamis.
