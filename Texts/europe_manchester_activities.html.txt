 Activities  Think Manchester and thoughts immediately turn to entertainment of the night-time variety: pubs, bars, clubs, theatre and live music, including performances by the city's acclaimed Halle Orchestra. If it's daytime, then it's Old Trafford and football or cricket. For a combination of fresh air, exercise and travel, how about boating the region's canalways - what better way to arrive in the city? Serious walking enthusiasts might like to head out to the nearby-ish Peak District National Park.
