 When to Go  One of Delhi's drawbacks is that for more than half the year the climate is lousy. For about five months - from November until the end of March - it is very good, with daytime temperatures between 21 and 30 C (70-86 F). By the end of April it's hot, while May and June are intolerable. In July it gets cooler but the humidity really hits, with all-day rain through August and September. The hugely colourful Republic Day march is held in January, while the exuberant Hindu festival of Holi takes place in February or March.     Events   Holi, in February or March, is one of the most exuberant Hindu festivals. To mark the end of winter, people chuck large quantities of coloured water and powder at one another - tourists are not excluded. In March or April, Hindus celebrate the birth of Rama by reading the Ramayana at temples throughout the city. In April or May, Sikhs have a similar celebration, Baisakhi where the holy book, the Granth Sahib is read, followed by feasting and dancing.  If you're in Delhi in July, don't miss the International Mango Festival, when Talkatora Stadium hosts hundreds of varieties of the heavenly fruit. August and September are happy festival months - during Ganesh Chaturthi, the elephant-headed god gets heaps of attention, while on Janmashtami, Krishna's birth is celebrated with plenty of mischief-making. Ram Lila, India's most popular festival, runs over 10 days in September or October. The Ramayana is reenacted and huge images of the demon Ravana are burnt. In late October, Hindu households light oil lamps to guide the god Rama home from exile, during the festival of Diwali, which is also known as the festival of sweets.  Delhi's Muslims celebrate the usual Muslim festivals. During Ramadan, the most important, Muslims fast from dawn to dusk to commemorate the revelation of the Qu'ran to Mohammed. When Ramadan ends, Muslims celebrate Id-ul-Fitr by eating a great deal and praying at the Jama Masjid.
