 Off the Beaten Track  Every Sunday morning the cobbled streets just south of the Reeperbahn are invaded by a fleet of small trucks which pour a market onto the banks of the Elbe. Locals have been wandering through the elaborate displays of fruit, vegetables and seafood every week since 1703. The market superstars are the stallholders, who flirt, cajole and tease passers-by, some proffering - with a healthy dose of innuendo - eels for sampling.  If you want more sedate entertainment, head for the Fischauktionshalle (Fish Auction Hall), where a live band covers obscure German pop. Everyone sings along; listen out for Nina's '99 Red Balloons' as you gobble a gourmet breakfast.
