 When to Go  Detroit is best visited in fall or spring, when the Detroit River is a recreation option and Michigan's foliage is at its most vibrant. During these seasons, the city's museums and sights are less crowded than in summer. Detroit is freezing cold in winter and unbearably humid in summer, with the height of discomfort hitting in July.     Events  The  International Freedom Festival is held in tandem with the Canadian city of Windsor as a joint celebration of Canada's Dominion Day (July 1) and the USA's Independence Day (July 4). Fireworks are set off from the Detroit River. The African World Festival, held the third weekend of August, shouts 'Africa' with music, art and food shared along Detroit's riverfront. One of the country's most prestigious jazz festivals, the Montreux Detroit Jazz Festival, is held over 5 days in September.
