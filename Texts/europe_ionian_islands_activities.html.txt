 Activities  The pretty fishing village of Vasiliki, on Lefkada, is purported to have the best windsurfing beach in Europe, and is an especially good place to learn the sport. All the islands apart from Kefallonia and Ithaki have water-skiing facilities. Snorkelling is especially good off Paleokastritsa, on Corfu's west coast, and there's also a diving school there and on Lefkada, Kefallonia and Zakynthos (independent diving is strictly forbidden in the Ionians). You don't have to emulate Onassis to enjoy yachting in the fabled waters of the Ionian Sea: join a crew, charter a yacht or hire your own motorboat. Trekking around the islands can be hugely enjoyable - but avoid July-August, as it's just too darn hot. Corfu's Ionian University runs courses in Modern Greek and Greek Civilisation in July-August - let's hope those classrooms are air-conditioned! Sunny Sundays in Corfu Town see cricket matches played on the only cricket ground in Greece.
