 Off the Beaten Track  Vi ey (Wood) Island is a small but potent historical site only 1km (0.6mi) northeast of Reykjavik, just clear of Sundahöfn Harbour. Originally piled up by volcanic action, it's thought that this 3km-long (1.9mi-long) sliver of rock was part of the land package claimed in the late-ninth century by Iceland's first official settler - Ing lfur Arnarson - and that it subsequently played host to a significant Augustinian monastery from 1226 until 1539. The island is also the site of Iceland's oldest original building, Vi eyjarstofa, built from basalt and sandstone in 1755 to be the residence of local sheriff Sk li Magn sson. Twenty years later saw the consecration of Iceland's second-oldest church, which has retained its original interior fittings.  Visitors can also explore the remains of a fort called Virki v and the weathered schoolhouse that is all that's left of an old Sundbakki Village on the island's southern tip. More-natural attractions include  Parad shellir (Paradise Cave), a pint-sized grotto with a fanciful name, and the beautiful basalt columns of Vesturey. Getting to Vi ey Island entails a five-minute ferry trip from Sundahöfn Harbour, which is just north of the outer-eastern suburb of Laugardalur.
