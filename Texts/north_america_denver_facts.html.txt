 When to Go  Depending on what you're after, Denver is a year-round destination. The winter ski season (roughly November through March) lures snow bunnies from around the globe, while drier times see hikers, bikers and climbers heading up, down and around every bump worth bagging. Naturalists will delight in watching dry and comfy autumn paint the landscape with more rusty lemon-yellows than a junkyard in Detroit. And springtime, while typically windy and wet, sees Colorado's oceans of wildflowers burst into bloom.     Events  Denver is a regional hub for cultural events, offering national touring acts year round at the massive Performing Arts Complex and summer performances at Red Rocks Amphitheater. Kicking off the new year in mid-January is the two-week National Western Stock Show & Rodeo, the largest show of its kind in the country. Mexico's independence is celebrated May 5th during Cinco de Mayo with two days of festivities at the 16th St Mall.  The first weekend in June, head to the Civic Center Park to see a quarter of a million diverse people at the Capitol Hill People's Fair - a gargantuan arts and crafts gala. The first weekend in July is the Cherry Creek Arts Festival, one of the country's largest arts and crafts shows. Bring a healthy appetite to A Taste of Colorado, a showcase of the region's top restaurant talent, held on Labor Day weekend in September at the Civic Center Park. Colorado's Shakespeare Festival is a six-week summer event at the University of Colorado-Boulder campus.
