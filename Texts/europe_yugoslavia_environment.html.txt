 Environment  Yugoslavia officially comprises Serbia, Montenegro, Vojvodina and the UN protectorate of Kosovo (the last three with dreams of independence), and is surrounded by (starting from the left and moving clockwise) Bosnia-Hercegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania and the Adriatic Sea. The southern half of this 102,173 sq km country is mountainous, while the north is a river-riven plain. Once a country of seaside resorts, Yugoslavia lost most of its coastline in the 1991-96 civil war. The 150km which remains has some spectacular scenery, including southern Europe's only fjord and some very long beaches. A side-effect of the war was that many of Yugoslavia's animals fled to native Bulgaria - this refugee fauna is now making its way home.  The climate varies from Mediterranean along the Adriatic coast and in the south of the country to continental and temperate further north and inland. Maximum summer (June to August) temperatures are around 26 degrees Celsius on the plains and on the coast - though it can get much hotter than this; in the mountains 17 degrees Celsius is the average. In winter (November to February) the mountains get down to -3 degrees Celsius, while the plains are a slightly more bearable 0 degrees Celsius, although a cold wind often blows across Belgrade. Here, the rain does not stay mainly in the plain, with about three times as much falling on the mountains as on the flat spots.
