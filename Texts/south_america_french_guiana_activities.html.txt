 Activities   Surfing, windsurfing and sailing are possible on the beaches near Cayenne and Kourou, but there are few facilities of any kind, so try to befriend a local. Canoe trips on Gabrielle Creek can be arranged at Dacca, a Laotian village near Roura. River trips on the Maroni River can be arranged from St Laurent du Maroni. Kaw is a good place for bird watching, and you can see leatherback turtles near Mana between April and September. There is a hiking trail from Remire-Montjoly to the top of Montagne du Mahury. There are great ecotourism opportunities in the forested interior, though trips are expensive.
