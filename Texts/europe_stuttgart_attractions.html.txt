 Attractions  Stuttgart's main square provides a crash course in architecture. Stand in the middle, beneath the König Wilhelm Jubilee column, flanked by fountains representing the eight rivers of Baden-Württemberg, then spin clockwise. The classical Königsbau is a focal point on warm evenings, when crowds gather to watch buskers perform amid its columns. Downstairs are shops, and upstairs, the city's Börse (stock exchange).  To the right is a fine example of 1950s architecture in the Olgabau, home to the Dresdner Bank. Further right is the Art Nouveau Kunstverein, which contains the municipal art gallery and the Württemberg Art Society. The Neues Schloss (New Palace), once the residence of kings Friedrich I and Wilhelm I, now houses the state finance and culture ministries. Begun in 1746 and completed in 1807, the Neues Schloss was destroyed during WWII. Painstaking restoration to its late-baroque/neoclassical splendor was completed in 1968.  At the western end of Schlossplatz is Alexander Calder's Mobile, a modern sculpture the city bought in 1981. There are concerts every Sunday in summer at the Musik Pavillon on the northwest corner of the square.
