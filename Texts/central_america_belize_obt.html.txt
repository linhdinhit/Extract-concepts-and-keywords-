 Off the Beaten Track  Perched at the southern tip of a long, narrow, sandy peninsula in Southern Belize, this laid-back beach town is worth every bump and grind of the dirt roads you need to travel to get here. All commerce and activity used to be carried out by boat, thus the village's 'main street' is just a narrow concrete footpath less than 1m (3ft) wide. The main attractions are the beaches and water sports, but there's also fishing, bird and manatee watching, overnight camping on remote cayes, and excursions to jungle rivers and the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary. The latter is home to jaguars, pumas, ocelots, margays, agoutis, anteaters, armadillos, boa constictors and birds galore.
