 Activities  There's no shortage of cultural options for those who want to progress beyond ordering sushi. You can take courses in the art of the tea ceremony, ikebana (flower arranging), shiatsu and zen meditation in various centres around the city. Or for cultural indulgence, you can head to a sento (public bath) or onsen (hot spring) to soak your cares away.  Unless you're based in a five-star hotel with its own facilities, most short-term visitors will probably have to make do without their favourite sporting activities. A lot of people and not much land means a high demand for recreational space - and high prices and long waiting lists. Still, the sports-minded can head to one of the many multi-storey, vertically unchallenged golf courses, get the kendo beaten out of them by attempting to learn a martial art, or brave the beaches of Kanagawa and Chiba in the Tokyo area. If you don't fancy swimming in the sea, there are pools that accept visitors.
