 Off the Beaten Track  Bouvetoya (54 42' S, 03 37' E) is the most isolated island on earth. The nearest substantial land mass is more than 1600km (990mi) away. Glaciers cover 93% of the 54 sq km (21 sq mi) island and prevent landings on the south and east coasts, while steep cliffs as high as 490m (1607ft) block access to the north, west and southwest. Sometime between 1955 and 1958, a low-lying shelf of lava appeared on Bouvetoya's west coast, providing the only bird nesting site of any size on the island. The island is rarely visited, but two events in its history are rather mysterious: first, a sunken lifeboat and assorted supplies were discovered on the island in 1964, but their origin could not be determined. Then, in September 1979, a thermonuclear bomb blast was detected to the west of Bouvetoya, though no country ever admitted to setting off a nuclear device there.
