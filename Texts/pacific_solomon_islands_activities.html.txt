 Activities  As with many Pacific islands, the greatest attraction for visitors to the Solomon Islands is diving. A combination of spectacular coral reefs and hundreds of WWII wrecks makes scuba diving, skin diving and snorkelling all attractive options. For technical divers, the Solomons is one of the three best spots in the world, though there are still plenty of options for the beginner. The water temperatures in the island group are among the warmest in the world, and visibility is commonly as good as 30m (100 ft). Beware crossing offshore reefs, as the ocean currents can be unbeatable, and - as always - keep local property customs in mind when bringing anything to the surface with you.  Other popular outdoor activities could keep you busy for months. There's bushwalking, canoeing, mountain and volcano climbing, swimming, surfing, fishing, shell-collecting, bird-watching, caving and mountain biking, enough to keep even the most dedicated adventurer sated.
