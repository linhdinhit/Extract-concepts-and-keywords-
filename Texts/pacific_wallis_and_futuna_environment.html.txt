 Environment  The Wallis & Futuna group lies midway between Fiji and the Samoas and has a total land area of 274 sq km (169 sq mi), making it 2.5 times the size of Paris. It's made up of 20 islets and three larger rocks that qualify as islands: Wallis, Futuna and Alofi. Low-lying Wallis is the main island, surrounded by a wide, shallow lagoon and littered with crater lakes formed by the long-defunct volcanos. In comparison Futuna and (unpopulated) Alofi are lagoonless. They both have mountainous interiors, with the high point of Futuna (and of the entire territory) the salubriously named Mt Puke, measuring a decent 524m (1700ft).  Ecologically, the territory suffers from a lack of significant native plants and animals, though Wallis does have an endemic lizard. Pigs (ceremonially killed in the islands' many festivals) are plentiful on all islands, especially Alofi, which is estimated to have 10,000 pigs in an area of only 51 sq km (32 sq mi). The large African snail arrived uninvited 20 years ago and after consistently eating its way through local crops has well and truly overstayed its welcome. The islands also suffer from extensive deforestation - not the result of invading multinational loggers but rather the use of wood by locals as the prime source of fuel. The removal of trees has caused extensive erosion and runoff into the oceans, particularly on Futuna.   If you're after consistency in your weather, these islands deliver. The archipelago enjoys a classic hot and tropical desert-island climate and the temperature has not dropped below 17 C (60 F) or risen over 33 C (90 F) in 30 years. May to October is dry while November to April brings the hotter rainy season, which also happens to be cyclone time. The islands are close to the meeting point of the Pacific and Indo-Australian continental plates and experience the odd bit of seismic activity. The last severe earthquake was in 1993.
