 Attractions  The blocks northwest of Hermann Park, a few miles southwest of downtown, are home to Houston's major museums. Old trees overhang the streets, and some of the city's grandest old homes take shelter in the deep shade of over-hanging Spanish moss. Many restaurants and cafes line the district's streets.  Founded in 1900, the Museum of Fine Arts is the oldest art museum in Texas. The large collection features French Impressionists, American Modernists and Texan Postmodernists. The sculpture garden across the street contains works by Rodin and others.  Nothing stays put for long inside the stainless steel walls of the Contemporary Arts Museum. With no permanent collection, the museum presents 10 or more temporary shows a year. Travelers with inner or outer children in tow should visit the crayon-colored playground for the mind known as the Children's Museum of Houston. Adults should have no problem having fun watching the tots milk the mechanical cow.  The Holocaust Museum is an excellent though sobering memorial. 'Our destination was extermination,' says Houstonian holocaust survivor Siegi Izakson on one of the many videos shown at this excellent museum, opened in 1996. The permanent exhibition, housed in a black cylinder meant to evoke the ghastly image of a smokestack, traces the lives of European Jews from before WWII, through the holocaust and after the war as the survivors tried to rebuild their lives.
