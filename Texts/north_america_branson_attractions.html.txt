 Attractions  For most visitors, this is what modern day Branson is all about. The 7mi (11km) stretch of Missouri State Hwy 76 is the economic backbone of the city - with over 50 theaters, 70 plus hotels and motels, and over 60 restaurants. The neon-lit strip is also home to shopping outlets, amusement parks, wax museums and other suitably cheesy tourist attractions. Look out for the 47ft (14m) long neck of the world's largest banjo jutting through the window of the Grand Country Market - it's the city's very own Eiffel Tower. Traveling treasure hunters, mostly retirees and families, jam all four lanes of the road from April to September.  When tourism to the area began increasing in the 1960s, 'The Strip' only had a few scattered shops and five music shows. However the cancellation of the Missouri Pacific's White River Line meant that most visitors were forced to arrive by motor vehicle. This in turn led to roadwork and new expanded highways and bypass routes. In 1957 the first music show opened, by the 1980s show numbers had increased to sixteen and today they now exceed 80. National Country stars, like Roy Clark, were the first to realize the potential of the area, and Roy gave his name to a theater. Now the names on the theaters read like a musical who's who and include Wayne Newton, the Osmonds, Charlie Pride, Kenny Rogers, Glen Campbell, Mel Tillis and Andy Williams amongst many others. With 61,714 theater seats, the city boasts more seats than New York City's Broadway district - now that's entertainment.
