 Activities  Lake Tahoe, near Reno, is Nevada's premier recreation area for skiing (cross-country and downhill), boating and fishing. Other popular fishing spots are Pyramid Lake, for its Lahontan cutthroat trout, and the Truckee River, right in the center of town (you'll need to get a license from a sports store first).  Reno is also a center for sky sports, and hosts big airplane and balloon races every September. If you want to sport among the clouds, there are plenty of commercial balloon and airplane operators in Reno and at Minden, about 50mi (80km) further south.
