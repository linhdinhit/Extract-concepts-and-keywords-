 When to Go  In Liverpool, as in the rest of England, April-September is the prime time to be out and about, with pleasant average temperatures of 65 F (18 C); the shoulder months of March and October aren't too bad weatherwise either. Visitor numbers hit a peak in July-August, and no wonder when August is festival time - it seems every weekend has an event or three to celebrate. Winter (November-February) is as miserable here as in any other windswept port town, and those 40 F (4 C) temperatures are best avoided.     Events  On the first Saturday in April the nation's eyes and ears focus on Liverpool's famous Aintree racecourse, where the gruelling Grand National steeplechase has been run every year since 1839. In June the Mersey River Festival celebrates the city's maritime connections, with tall ships, marines and family fun. Liverpool dubs itself the Festival City, and August is definitely festival month. Events kick off with the Merseyside International Street Festival, and more street theatre than you can throw 10p at. The inevitable Beatle theme raises its moptop in late-August's Mathew St Festival - Britain's biggest annual city-centre music event - coinciding with International Beatle Week. The Creamfields Dance Festival, the UK's biggest and best dance party, also hits Liverpool in August. The River Mersey Fireworks Festival lights up the skyline on Guy Fawkes Night (5 November).  Most businesses close on New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day Bank Holiday (the first Monday in May), Spring Bank Holiday (the last Monday in May), Summer Bank Holiday (the last Monday in August), Christmas Day and Boxing Day (26 December).
