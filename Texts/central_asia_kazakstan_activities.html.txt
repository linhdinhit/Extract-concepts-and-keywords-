 Activities   Trekking and mountaineering are particularly good in the Zailiysky Alatau and the Küngey, notably around Medeu, Shymbulaq and Kokshoky. There are more opportunities in eastern Kazakstan in the Zhungarsky Alatau range east of Taldy-Qorghan and in the Altay mountains in the country's north-east. The safest way to go trekking is through a reliable agency and with a guide, though you're advised to bring your own equipment since gear is hard to come by. The best trekking season is between June and September, though be prepared for bad weather at any time.   Shymbulaq is Central Asia's best known downhill ski area and is only a day trip from Almaty. January and February are the peak months of the ski season. A few local travel agents offer ski-mountaineering trips in the central Tian Shan in July and August, and in the Alatau range between Almaty and Lake Issyk-Kul from February through April. Nearly every sports-related agency offers heli-skiing to remote high peaks in old Aeroflot helicopters.   Rafting and canoeing trips on remote rivers can be arranged by several travel agencies. There is easy rafting and canoeing on the Ili River between Lake Qapshaghay and Lake Balqash, north of Almaty, from mid-April to mid-October.
