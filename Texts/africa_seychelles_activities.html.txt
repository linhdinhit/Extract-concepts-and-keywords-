 Activities  The Seychelles are all about water. Snorkelling is a must-do for every visitor - the best sports around Mahe are Ste anne, Anse Soleil, Petite Anse and le Souris. Off Praslin, try around Chauve Souris Island. Diving, particularly around the outlying islands, is considered world class. There are several schools offering courses and equipment is available for hire. Windsurfing is particularly popular on Mahe and Praslin. Plenty of charter operation will take you deep-sea fishing.  For hydrophobes, the Seychelles still has plenty on offer. There are some fine challenges for rock climbers, particularly on Praslin and La Digue, where there's great block and cliff-face climbs. There are some great hikes, many of which are described in great detail in a series of brochures produced by the Tourism Division.
