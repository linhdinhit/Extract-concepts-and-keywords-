 Activities  Hawaii is a fantastic place to enjoy watersports and recreational activities. Surfing is the king of sports, and Hawaii is deservedly renowned for its great waves. Beginners can learn the basics at Waikiki, then watch the professionals on Oahu's North Shore. Maui has become a windsurfing mecca, with the top international windsurfers heading for Hookipa Beach. Diving is good year-round and there are plenty of underwater caves, canyons, lava tubes, vertical walls and sunken ships to explore. Lanai, the sunken volcanic crater of Molokini, and Oahu and Kauai's northern coasts are all great diving areas. The Big Island's Kona Coast offers some of the world's best deep-sea fishing for Pacific blue marlin, yellowfin tuna and spearfish. And for those who want to keep their feet on solid ground, hiking opportunities include trails in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Haleakala National Park and Hawaii's premier hike along Kauai's Na Pali Coast.
