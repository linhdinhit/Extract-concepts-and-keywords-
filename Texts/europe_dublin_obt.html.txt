 Off the Beaten Track  About 45km (28mi) southwest of Dublin is scenic Kildare, a small cathedral and market town in County Kildare. The cathedral is St Brigid's, named after one of Ireland's favourite saints, with its origins as a religious centre founded in the 5th century. A west-facing stained-glass portrait of Brigid and fellow saints Patrick and Columbia is one of the cathedral's main features, although the most significant is the tomb of Walter Wellesley, a bishop of Kildare in the early 16th century.  A few kilometres south of town is the National Stud, the government-sponsored cornerstone of the country's horse-breeding industry. There are guided tours of the stud and there's also a museum, which pays homage to Irish equine greats and to the role of the horse in Irish history. Right next door to the stud are the Japanese Gardens, an attempt at philosophical landscaping, which uses a series of landmarks to signify the journey of life. The gardens are regarded as one of the best examples of the Japanese style in Europe. Bus services from Dublin take about an hour to reach Kildare; trains run about every 40 minutes from Heuston station and take about 30 minutes for the 55km (34mi) trip.
