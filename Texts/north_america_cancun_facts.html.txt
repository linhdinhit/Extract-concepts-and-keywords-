 When to Go  Canc n has the sun on permanent retainer. The city's temperature averages an idyllic 80 F (27 C) year-round, dipping painlessly from time to time, hitting 65 F (19 C) in January. It can swelter to 100 F (38 C) in May, though ocean breezes keep it more bearable than the rest of the Yucat n, which can get drenchingly muggy and hot. Rainfall is rare, though violent storms called nortes can roll in on any afternoon, their black clouds, high winds and torrents of rain followed within an hour by bright sun and blue sky. Hurricane season lasts from July to November. Canc n last got clobbered in 1988 by Hurricane Gilbert.  November and early December are perhaps the best times to go, as there are fewer tourists and prices are low. The busy season is from mid-December to April, when prices are noticeably higher. Surcharges get tacked on around the Christmas, New Year's and Easter holidays.     Events  Canc n treats every day as a holiday, but also plans a few organized events throughout the year. The biggest event is Carnaval, a joyous, usually drunken celebration held in February right before Lent's period of fasting and penitence. Inmaculada Concepcion is a religious festival held on Isla Mujeres in December.  The athletically inclined might consider running Canc n's International Marathon right before the mad Christmas tourist rush.
