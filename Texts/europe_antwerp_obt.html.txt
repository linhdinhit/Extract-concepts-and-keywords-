 Off the Beaten Track  Located 2km (1.25mi) southeast of Centraal Station and snuggled up against the 'Ring', the busy motorway that angles around the eastern edge of the city, is the architecturally sublime neighbourhood of Zurenborg. Chosen by Antwerp's wealthiest residents a century ago as the place where they would feverishly embrace (and also compete with) the then-current Art-Nouveau craze, the streets at the heart of this district yield a breathtaking vista of decorative constructions. The showcase thoroughfare is Cogels-Osylei, where intricate Art-Nouveau and gaudy baroque facades impatiently shoulder neo-classical columns and neo-Renaissance symmetry; all of the structures were built between 1894 and 1914.  Hanging around the roundabout on Cogels-Osylei are the chateaux-imitating Wiltte Paleizen (White Palaces), while Art-Nouveau dominates the frontages of the Huize Zonnebloem (Sunflower House) and De Morgenster (Morning Star) elsewhere on the street. On nearby Waterloostraat are the wonderful mosaic motifs of De Vier Seizoenen (The Four Seasons) and the confidently named Les Mouettes (The Dumb). Hidden on the smaller streets just beyond Waterloostraat are other architectural finds like the neo-classical Euterpia House and the leering wooden figures occupying Twaalf Duivels (Twelve Devils). Catch tram No 11 from the centre and let it run you along Cogels-Osylei.
