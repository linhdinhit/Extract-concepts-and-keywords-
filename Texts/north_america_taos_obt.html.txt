 Off the Beaten Track  On Highway 64 about 12mi (19km) northwest of Taos, the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge is the second-highest suspension bridge in the USA. Built in 1965, the vertigo-inducing steel bridge spans 500ft (150m) across the gorge and 650ft (200m) above the river below. The views west over the emptiness of the Taos Plateau and down into the jagged walls of the Rio Grande are incredible. From Taos, turn left at the blinking light and head out past the airport.
