 Activities  Other than lazing under a palm tree, snorkelling all those coral reefs rimming the atolls or persuading an accommodating local to take you fishing, there's not a lot to do in Tokelau. Surprise! All three atolls have community discos every now and then, as well as weekly bingo, and you shouldn't miss watching a game of  kilikiti - better yet, as more seems to be the merrier, join in. You'll get a confirmed six if you can hit the ball into the water with the wonky, three-sided 'bat'. If you decide to go diving in the lagoons, take extreme care as there are no lifesavers to rescue you, and the nearest decompression chamber is in Fiji. Ask the locals for advice about the safest diving spots.
