 Activities  The rolling hills and marked trails of the Wienerwald are perfect for hiking. Tourist guides conduct around 40 different guided walking tours of the city, covering everything from Art Nouveau architecture to Viennese Jewish traditions. The Prater also has a wood with walking trails, and of course it's the place to go for a ride on the city's much-photographed Ferris wheel (Riesenrad). Cycling is a popular activity, especially along the banks of the Danube. There are plenty of swimming options, from indoor and outdoor pools to nude beaches on both banks of the New Danube (Neue Donau). Both the Old Danube and the New Danube provide opportunities for water sports such as sailing and rowing, windsurfing and water skiing.
