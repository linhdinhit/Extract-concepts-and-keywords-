 Activities  Unsurprisingly in a country of resorts, Cyprus has plenty of places where you can indulge in water sports. If it's windsurfing or sailing you want, head to the peninsulas and capes, where the wind is strongest. There's also at least one diving site in each of the big resorts. Mountain biking and hiking are possible all over the island, with specially marked trails in the southern hills, on the Akamas Peninsula and in the Troödos. Although hardly renowned for its skiing, Cyprus does have a resort on the northeastern face of Mount Olympus, but it's not exactly world standard. And what would a package tourist destination be without golf - several courses are complete or under construction; the most popular are in the Pafos district.
