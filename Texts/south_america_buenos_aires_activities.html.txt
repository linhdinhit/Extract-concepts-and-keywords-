 Activities  The arts are king in Buenos Aires; there is only one activity to master in this city and it is without doubt dancing. Luckily tango, flamenco, Latin, salsa and folk lessons are widely available in clubs around San Telmo barrio (details available at tourist offices). Not surprisingly, live music is also extremely popular among porte os, with some good jazz clubs about the city. Theater and opera also enjoy a strong traditional patronage. If anything embodies Argentine passion greater than the tango, it is their national religion -  futbol - and Buenos Aires is home to the fervor of cross-town rivals Boca Juniors (where Maradona played) and River Plate. Even non-football types should try and get to a live match for the drama, theatrics and hysteria - and that's all before the whistle has even blown.
