 Off the Beaten Track  Small, unhurried Terre-de-Haut is French in nature, Mediterranean in appearance and, all in all, one of the most appealing islands in the Caribbean. It's a tiny package with a lot to offer, including a beautiful landscape of volcanic hills and deep bays, though it can get overrun with tourists on weekends and in the height of the season. Many islanders still rely on fishing as a mainstay. You can often find them mending nets along the waterfront and see their colorful locally made boats, called saintoises, lining the shore.  Terre-de-Haut's history stands apart from other places in Guadeloupe; since the island was too hilly and dry for sugar plantations, slavery never took hold. Consequently, the population is largely comprised of 'blue eyes' who still trace their roots to the early seafaring Norman and Breton colonists. Home to most of the island's residents, Bourg des Saintes is a picturesque village with a decidedly Norman accent. Its narrow streets are lined with whitewashed red-roofed houses with shuttered windows and yards of flowering hibiscus. It's a bustling place at ferry times, quiet at others, and always fun to kick around in. There are small restaurants, ice-cream shops, scooter rentals, art galleries and gift shops clustered along the main road, which is pedestrian-only during the day. The well-preserved mid-19th-century Fort Napoleon, on the northern side of the harbor, is surrounded by cacti gardens.
