If a bit of sand in the face doesn't bother you, go in January when you can attend the Sallah celebrations in northern Nigeria followed by the Argungu Fishing Festival on the banks of the Sokoto River in mid-to-late February.     Events  Of all the festivals in West Africa the most elaborate are the ones held in northern Nigeria - in particular Kano, Zaria and Katsina - for the two most important Islamic holidays: the end of Ramadan (the Islamic period of fasting) and Tabaski (69 days later). The exact dates differ from year to year but is usually sometime in late January or early February and again in late April. The principal event of the celebrations is the Durbar, a colourful parade of ornately dressed Hausa-Fulani horsemen, Emirs dressed in ceremonial robes, bicep-flexing wrestlers and lute players in headdresses.  Occurring shortly after the Sallah celebrations is the Argungu Fishing and Cultural Festival (sometime in mid to late February) on the banks of the Sokoto River. This internationally acclaimed festival is fishing with a difference and involves barehanded fishing, duck hunting, swimming and other watery competitions. More water-based celebrations take place around August at the Pategi Regatta, halfway between Ibadan and Kaduna, with the highlight of the regatta being the rowing competition.
