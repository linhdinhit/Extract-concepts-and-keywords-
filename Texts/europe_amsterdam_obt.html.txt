 Off the Beaten Track  The Jordaan is an old working-class neighbourhood, now partly colonised by students, artists and trendies. This is a great place to wander around, get lost and soak up the atmosphere of people going about their daily business. Houses here are tiny but tidy, with lace curtains and window boxes, and spionnetje (little spy) mirrors attached to the windowsills so auntie Greet can see who's coming and going. The Jordaan is full of inviting pubs and restaurants, offbeat shops, weird little art galleries and lively markets. There's also a high concentration of hofjes (courtyards) here, many of them with beautifully restored houses and lovingly maintained gardens. In theory, they're closed to the public, but if you do come across one of the unobtrusive entrances, and it is unlocked, most residents won't mind if you sneak a peek.
