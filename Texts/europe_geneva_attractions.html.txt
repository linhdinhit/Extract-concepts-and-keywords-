 Attractions  During a gruesome battle for independence in northern Italy in 1859, Genevan philanthropist and businessman Henry Dunant was moved to action by the plight of dying and suffering soldiers. He made the proposal that 'some international principle, sanctioned by a Convention inviolate in character...might constitute the basis for societies for the relief of the wounded'. So, formed on the back of the Geneva Convention in 1864, the International Red Cross became the world's first humanitarian organisation. Its museum highlights the fascinating origins and growth of the Red Cross (and the Muslim adjunct, the Red Crescent), and presents a compelling multimedia trawl through atrocities perpetuated by humanity in recent history. Although the message is supposed to be one of hope and a collective responsibility to humanity, it is the images and stories of terror that are more psychologically lasting. Despite the sombre nature of the museum it is well worth a visit.  To change the mood, head east for a bit and check out the gorgeous Musee Ariana, one of Europe's most important and comprehensive kilncraft museums - and it's a freebie. In Switzerland this is not an offer to be scoffed at, plus they sell great coffee mugs. If that isn't your cup of tea, the United Nations is only a short hop east of the museum (you'll need to bring your passport to get inside). You can take a moderately interesting hour-long tour among the 3000-odd international civil servants working there, but you're not likely to see any delicate negotiations or chest thumping taking place. Buses 8 and F from Place de Cornavin drop you outside the Red Cross Museum.
