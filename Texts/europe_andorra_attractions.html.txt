 Attractions  Andorra la Vella, the capital of the principality and its largest town, sits at an elevation of just over 1000m (3280ft). It's surrounded by mountains up to 2400m (7870ft) high. These days, the town itself is given over almost entirely to the retailing of duty-free electronics and luxury goods, and it's more likely to recall the clang and clatter of a bustling Asian marketplace than it is the grace and elegance of Europe's grand old capitals. Happily, not all the vestiges of its 1100 year history have succumbed to the jackhammer.  The Barri Antic (Old Quarter) was the heart of Andorra la Vella when it was little more than a small Pyrenean village. The narrow cobblestone streets are still lined with storybookish stone houses. The pride of the Barri Antic is the Casa de la Vall (House of the Valley), which has served as Andorra's parliament building since 1702. The three storey stone structure was built in 1580 as the private home of a wealthy family; the Andorran coat-of-arms over the door dates from 1761. Downstairs is the Sala de la Justicia, the only courtroom in the whole country. Upstairs is the Sala del Consell, where the parliament still convenes. The Set Panys (Chest of the Seven Locks) once held Andorra's most important documents and could only be opened if one key-bearing representative from each of the parishes was present.  Cultural events take place at Pla a la Poble, a large public square that is bordered by Andorra la Vella's theatre and music academy. It's also a popular gathering spot for locals in the evening.
