 Environment  Tiny Kuwait sits at the north-western tip of the Persian Gulf, bordered to the north and west by Iraq and to the south by Saudi Arabia. It's about the size of Slovenia or the US state of New Jersey. Kuwait's land is mostly flat and arid with little or no ground water. The desert is generally gravelly, and the only vegetation in existence is scrub. The only significant geographic feature is the now infamous Al-Mutla ridge, where Allied aircraft massacred a column of retreating Iraqi forces in the closing hours of the Persian Gulf war.  In the summer (April to September) Kuwait is hellishly hot; its only saving grace is that it's nowhere near as humid as its neighbours. The winter months are often pleasant, featuring some of the region's coolest weather, with daytime temperatures hovering around 18 C (64 F) and nights being genuinely chilly. Sandstorms occur throughout the year but are particularly common in spring.
