 Off the Beaten Track  Although only 50km (32mi) south of Bata, the trip to Mbini involves a minibus and a ferry, and can take some time. The ferry, which runs hourly, carries only four vehicles, so expect a wait. Mbini is a pleasant town at the mouth of the Rio Benito. A popular spot for swimming, it's also an ideal place to meet locals in a low-key environment.
