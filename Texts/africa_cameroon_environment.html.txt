 Environment  About the size of Spain or California and shaped a bit like a boot, Cameroon is bordered by Nigeria to the north and west, Chad and the Central African Republic to the east, Congo, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.  Cameroon is one of the most geographically diverse countries in Africa, comprising three major zones: the northern savannah, the southern and eastern rainforests, and the north-western hill region near Nigeria. Rich volcanic soils near the towns of Bafoussam and Bamenda in the west have permitted much higher rural population densities than elsewhere in the country. The west is coffee and cocoa country and home to nearly a quarter of the population. The hot, dry north is home to Lake Chad, the major game reserves, rocky escarpments and the broad Benoue River.  The country's game reserves teem with elephants, lions, giant eland, bongos, chimpanzees, crocodiles and birds galore. There are a few remaining lowland gorilla families in remote pockets of the underdeveloped south-east.  The variations in rainfall from one region to the next are astounding - from barely enough rain to support agriculture in the extreme north to over 500cm (200in) in the south-west around Mt Cameroon. In the north, the rainy season is from June to September; in the south, light rains in March and April are followed by downpours from May to November. Humidity soars in the south in July and August. The warmest months are March to May, when the average daily high is 30 C (86 F) in Yaounde; Douala is cooler but gets much more rain. During the same period, the north gets up to a scorching 40 C (104 F).
