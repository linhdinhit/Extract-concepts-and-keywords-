 Environment  Fountain Square is the nucleus of the downtown, which has Central Parkway and Third St as its north and south boundaries; Central Ave and Sycamore St are the east-west dividing lines. The downtown is then surrounded by hills on three sides. The hills of the Mt Adams and Eden Park Districts, both east of downtown, proffer lovely views and cultural and gastronomic attractions.  The state park system has an extensive network of hiking trails, the majority of which can be tackled as day hikes. Two major backpacking trails are maintained in the state forest system: Shawnee (60 mi/97km) and Zaleski (23mi/37km). The Buckeye Trail is the state's jewel. It originally linked Mentor Headlands Beach on Lake Erie to Eden Park in Cincinnati. It has since been extended to all four corners of the state, topping out at 1200mi (1931km).  Cincinnati is best visited during any season other than the winter, when temperatures can be unbearably cold and blizzards make sightseeing difficult.
