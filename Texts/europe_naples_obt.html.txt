 Off the Beaten Track  Work on a new palace for Charles of Bourbon started in 1738 and took almost a century to complete. On the northern edge of the city, the distinctive pinky-orange and grey palace is set in glorious parklands that were once aristocratic hunting grounds. Extensively restored during the last decade, the palace houses the Museo e Gallerie di Capodimonte, which displays the important Farnese collection. The extensive collection boasts works by Bellini, Botticelli, Caravaggio, Correggio, Masaccio and Titian. One of its most famous paintings is Masaccio's Crocifissione (Crucifixion). Other highlights are Bellini's Trasfigurazione (Transfiguration), and nine canvases by Titian.
