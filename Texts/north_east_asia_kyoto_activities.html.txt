 Activities  There's an infinite number of things to do in Kyoto besides visiting temples and shrines. In addition to shopping, hiking and people-watching, there are many places to get hands-on experience in traditional arts and crafts. If calligraphy is your thing, you can go to the Shoho-in Temple and try your hand at copying Buddhist scriptures in some of Kyoto's most peaceful surrounds; you'll be provided with brushes and all materials. If you'd like to learn more about the tea ceremony it's possible, at the Research Centre in Northern Kyoto, to view a 20 minute tea-making procedure and also sample a bowl of matcha. If braiding appeals to you, check out braid-maker Adachi Kumihimo-kan, who has a gallery of beautiful pieces on display; you can weave your own braid on wooden hand looms. Kyoto is well kitted out with  ikebana schools. Paper-making courses are also available, and there are several schools offering pottery classes.  Several of Kyoto's Zen temples offer public  zazen (seated meditation) where you can discover what the 'mystery' of Zen is all about. Though these temples welcome visitors to participate, bear in mind that zazen is not held for the benefit of tourists and may not always live up to the perfect image of bald monks in robes. After a day spent marching from temple to temple, nothing feels better than a good hot bath. Kyoto is full of sento (public baths), ranging from small neighbourhood baths with one or two tubs to massive complexes offering saunas, mineral baths and even electric baths.
