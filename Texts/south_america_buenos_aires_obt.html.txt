 Off the Beaten Track  Only an hour north of Buenos Aires by train (slightly longer by bus) is the tranquil suburb of Tigre, a good base for discovering life on the canals of the Delta del Paran and making trips across to Uruguay. Buenos Aires' porte os come here to retreat and it can get busy on weekends.  Also popular are trips to Isla Mart n Garc a, only 2km (1.2mi) off the Uruguayan coast and a short ferry trip from Tigre. The park-like island is an all-in-one historical monument, nature reserve and recreational retreat. With the densely forested delta nearby, the island was used as a prison camp (including four ex-presidents) and strategic observation point to guard against smugglers and protect the approaches to R o Uruguay and R o Paran .
