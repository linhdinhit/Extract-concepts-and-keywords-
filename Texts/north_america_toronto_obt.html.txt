 Off the Beaten Track  The roaring spectacle of Horseshoe Falls - Canada's half of Niagara Falls - makes the town of Niagara Falls one of Canada's top tourist destinations, drawing over 12 million people annually. Canada's falls are grander and more powerful than the US Bridal Veil Falls, plunging 56m (185ft) down into the Maid of the Mist pool and clouding views of the falls from afar. The equivalent of more than 1 million bathtubs full of water goes over the falls every second. Even in winter, when the flow is partially hidden and the edges frozen solid - like a freeze-framed film - it's quite a sight.  There are numerous pay-for-view options to see the falls. Maid of the Mist boats take passengers up close for a loud and wet view from the bottom of the falls. From near Table Rock Information Centre you can don a plastic poncho and walk down through rock-cut tunnels halfway down the cliffside - as close as you can get to the falls without getting in a barrel (or going over to the USA side). You can also head to either the Minolta Tower or Skylon Tower to gaze at the falls from observation decks. About 6km (3.7mi) north of Horseshoe Falls on the Niagara River is the Spanish Aero Car - a sort of gondola stretched 550m (1800ft) between two outcrops that takes you above a whirlpool so you can see everything spinning in the water below.  Niagara Falls is about a two-hour drive from Toronto. Buses run every two hours or so and trains run twice a day.
