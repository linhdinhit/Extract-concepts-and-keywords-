 Activities   Safari means 'we go' in Swahili, and nearly everyone who visits southern Africa plans on at least one 'go', as there's no better way to experience the region's spectacular wildlife. Usually, visitors do their spotting from a swanky 4WD, but it's also possible to do it on horseback rides. Most trips through the Okavango Delta include some hiking on the palm islands, and the Tsodilo Hills are particularly attractive for bushwalking. You can also go fishing in the Okavango.
