 Attractions  Situated on the western border, Lesotho's capital has been a quiet backwater for most of its history, expanding rapidly only since the 1970s to its current population of a little over 200,000 people. Maseru paved its first road in 1947 for a visit by British royals, and for some years Kingsway remained the only such road in the country. For a 3rd world city in the middle of a period of massive expansion, however, Maseru manages to maintain a laid-back feel.  Surrounding the capital are 'urban villages', such as Phomolong where you can get a first-hand look at a more traditional lifestyle. In the town itself, there are several nightspots frequented by expats - mostly workers for aid organisations - who can give you advice about things to do during your stay in return for a beer or three.
