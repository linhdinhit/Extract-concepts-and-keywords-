 Off the Beaten Track  Near the High Atlas town of Tinerhir, at the end of a lush valley of palms and mud-brick villages hemmed in by barren craggy mountains is one of Morocco's most glorious natural sights. This is the Todra Gorge: some 300m high but only 10m wide at its narrowest point, and with a crystal clear river running through it.  Although the main gorge can be explored in half a day, those with more time should head further up the gorge towards Tinerhir. There are numerous kasbahs and the people here are very friendly. Rock climbing is becoming increasingly popular on the vertical rock face of the gorge and camping around the base is also an attractive option.  There are plenty of hotels in and around the gorge itself. For the more adventurous, a network of difficult pistes links the sporadic villages here in the High and Middle Atlas mountains. Regular buses pass through Tinerhir en route between Marrakesh and Er-Rachidia.
