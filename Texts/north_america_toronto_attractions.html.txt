 Attractions  Downtown encompasses many of Toronto's most significant and easily accessible attractions. The CN Tower - at 533m (1748ft) the highest freestanding structure in the world since 1976 - has become a symbol and landmark of Toronto. Impressive views only go so far, however, and many find the cost and long queues to the observation deck a turn-off. A better deal might be to dine in its 360 Revolving Restaurant instead. If feats of engineering really rock your boat, you may want to also visit the SkyDome next door. It features the world's first fully retractable dome roof, a striking interior and a playing field large enough to park eight 747s.  The Old Town of York is the city's truly unmissable attraction. Many of Toronto's oldest and best-preserved buildings can be found here. Highlights include the Flatiron Building, with its triangular shape and famous trompe l'oeil mural, and the St Lawrence Market, whose Market Gallery hosts exhibits of art and historic artifacts relating to the city. The North Market's clock tower is one of the city's finest examples of Victorian classicism. The venerable St James Cathedral is graced by Tiffany stained glass, a grand organ and the tallest spire in Canada. Pay your respects to the city by strolling up Toronto St, a narrow street full of elegant triple-story 19th-century office buildings.  The Harbourfront area is jumping with galleries and cultural centers, and its lakeshore breezes make for pleasant strolling when the humidity is up. A little further north, historic buildings such as Mackenzie House, Osgoode Hall and Campbell House vie for attention with the restored grandeur of the Elgin & Winter Garden Theatre Centre. Galleries and museums abound - the Art Gallery of Ontario and Museum for Textiles are two especially worth your time. Chinatown's bustling restaurants and stores add some spice to the mix.
