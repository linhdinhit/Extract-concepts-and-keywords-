 Attractions  The oldest w t (temple or monastery) in the city, Wat Chiang Man was founded by King Mengrai in 1296 and features typical Northern Thai temple architecture with massive teak columns inside the b t (central sanctuary).  There are two important Buddha images in a cabinet to the right of this area. The first, Phra Sila, stands about 25cm (10in) tall, and reputedly came from Sri Lanka or India 2500 years ago. Chances are it isn't quite that old (Buddha images weren't created for about another 500 years), but it's still an extremely impressive and revered artefact. The other, a crystal seated Buddha only 10cm (4in) in height is about 1800 years old. Known as the Phra Satang Man, it was shunted back and forth between Thailand and Laos for centuries before finding a permanent home here at Chiang Man. The w t is in the north east corner of the old city.
