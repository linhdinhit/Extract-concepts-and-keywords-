 Off the Beaten Track  What can you say about a mall housing more than 500 stores, 70 restaurants, 14 movie screens, a wedding chapel, an 18-hole mini-golf course, a gargantuan aquarium and a Camp Snoopy amusement park, all under one roof? For starters you could say it's the largest darn mall in America, an immense consumer-driven entertainment complex that simply boggles the mind. With 42.5 million yearly visitors (more than Disney World, Graceland and the Grand Canyon combined), it's the USA's fifth-most visited attraction.  This mini-city lies in the southern suburb of Bloomington, a short drive from downtown Minneapolis. The airport is also nearby, so shoppers can jump from in-flight meals to in-store deals.
