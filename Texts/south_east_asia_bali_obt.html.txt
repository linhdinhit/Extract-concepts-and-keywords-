 Off the Beaten Track  The Pejeng region around Ubud hides some of Bali's most ancient monuments and relics. Set in the bottom of a lush green valley surrounded by terraced rice paddies are the 10 impressive rock-cut shrines of Gunung Kawi. The shrines are carved out of the rock face in imitation of actual statues - in a similar fashion to the great rock-cut temples of Ajanta and Ellora in India. Less spectacular, but equally important, are the rock carvings at Yeh Pulu, the Pura Samuan Tiga temple and Goa Gajah (the elephant cave) - all just a couple of kilometres east of Ubud. The best way to access these sites is to catch a bemo from Ubud or rent a mountain bike.
