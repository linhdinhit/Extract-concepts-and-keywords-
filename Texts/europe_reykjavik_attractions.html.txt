 Attractions  In case you can't recognise it from its aged buildings and sense of order (in contrast to the rapidly changing outskirts of New Reykjavik), it may pay to know that the Icelandic capital's Old Town is bound by Tjörn, Lækjargata, the residential area of Seltjarnarnes and the touristy shop-filled environs of the city's harbour district. Right in the middle is Austurvöllur, once the bustling Old Town Square and now a subdued and grassy park. Another of the area's grandeur-shy historical assets is D mkirkja, a fairly unremarkable but nonetheless significant stone structure built by a Danish king in 1796 to mark the Lutheran-inspired removal of the Catholic bishoprics. At the more recent end of the historical spectrum is the confrontingly postmodern R h s (City Hall), a prominent - some locals would argue far-too-prominent - building that opened its doors to Reykjavik's administrators and information-hungry tourists in 1992.  In his capacity as the secretary of Copenhagen's Royal Archives, rni Magn sson spent a decade from 1702 dashing around Iceland collecting vellum (calfskin or lambskin treated for use as a writing surface) dating from a 13th-century period known as the Saga Age. A fire in 1728 destroyed most of his collection, but the survivors have been on display since 1971 in Reykjavk's  rni Magn sson Institute - the best-known of these epic tales of romance and drama is Nj ls Saga. Another Magn sson (Sk li) was responsible for building the F getinn, a 1752 weaving shed that is now the city's oldest building. The Kolaporti Flea Marketis the country's largest, open from Friday through Sunday and dispensing everything from cheap clothes, secondhand books and domestic knick-knacks to items that only have the appearance of a bargain.
