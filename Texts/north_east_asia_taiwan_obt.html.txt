 Off the Beaten Track  About 62km (38mi) off the south-east coast of Taiwan, Lanyu is a rocky, volcanic island with a tropical climate. Lanyu is very different from the rest of Taiwan: most of the inhabitants are Yami aborigines, culturally closer to the Philippines than to China. Traditionally, the Yami speak their own dialect (which is nothing like Chinese), build houses underground to avoid typhoons, and live by cultivating taro and sweet potato and catching fish. Of course, Lanyu is not untouched by the modern world, and you'll see Levis about as often as loincloths. There are a few small Chinese business on the island, and fairly easy access to taxis, TV, beer and cigarettes, so don't expect an unspoilt tribal paradise.  Unspoilt or not, Lanyu is a beautiful place. The coastal scenery - jagged, black volcanic rock - can be breathtaking, if not exactly conducive to swimming. One of the best ways to occupy yourself on Lanyu is to walk the island's circumference, 37km (23mi) all up. There are a few places to stay and eat, and you can camp out if you ask nicely. Small prop-planes fly between Lanyu and Taitung or Kaohsiung, or you can take the not-too-pleasant boat trip from Taitung via Green Island.
