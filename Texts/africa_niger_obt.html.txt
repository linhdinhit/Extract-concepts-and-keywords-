 Off the Beaten Track  The Tenere Desert, 500km (310mi) as the crow flies northeast of Agadez, is an enormous emptiness that extends over 700km (434mi) of space. It is often known as the desert of deserts, and reputedly has some of the most beautiful sand dunes in the entire Sahara. If you head east toward Bilma, you'll pass close to the dinosaur cemetery, full of fossils spread out over 150km (65mi) of constantly shifting sand dunes. Further into the desert is the Djado Plateau, with its ruined villages, rock engravings and glorious landscapes, and after that the oases of the Kaouar Plateau, where you'll find Bilma and Fachi, places that truly look, and feel, like the end of the earth.  Most travellers are better off looking for a reliable organised tour that will take in both the A r Mountains and the Tenere Desert. You can rent a car and a guide if you can't find a good tour group, but make sure that the terms of the hiring are clearly spelled out. Attempting the crossing on your own is not recommended. Government authorisation is required for all such trips. The distance from Niamey to the edge of the Tenere Desert is over 1500km (930mi).
