 Activities  If you can tear yourself away from the gaming tables, the rough-hewn areas around Las Vegas offer great hiking. Red Rock Canyon, about 20 miles (30km) west of the city, has multicolored sandstone scenery. Toiyabe National Forest, further west, features 12,000ft (3700m) Charleston Peak and trails that wind through pine forests and desert scrub. Camping is allowed.  For boating and water-skiing, smear on the sunscreen, slither into your wetsuit and head over to Lake Mead, about 30mi (50km) east of Las Vegas. You can even scuba dive here. The lake's 500mi (800km) of shoreline offer plenty of sunbathing spots. Skiers can thrill to the downhill at the Lee Canyon Ski Area on Charleston Peak in the Toiyabe National Forest, about 80mi (130km) northwest of Las Vegas.  Urbanites can tenpin bowl - it's a huge pastime in Las Vegas. There are dozens of golf courses in Las Vegas Valley, most within 10mi (16km) of The Strip. Unless you can pony up US$30,000 up front plus US$350 a month for membership of a private club, you'll be playing at a public course. Reserve your tee-off time a week in advance.
