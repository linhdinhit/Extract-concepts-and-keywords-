 Attractions  Atlantic City's famous Boardwalk was the first in the world, built in 1870 by local business owners who wanted to cut down on sand being tracked into hotel lobbies by guests returning from the beach. Alexander Boardman came up with the idea, and the long stretch of planks became known as Boardman's Walk - later shortened to 'Boardwalk.' The Boardwalk is still the lifeline of the city and the path that leads to all doors. It runs along an 8mi (13km) stretch of beach where visitors sunbathe, picnic and swim.  If you're interested in losing some serious currency or just want to check out the grand gambling halls, there are several along the the Boardwalk. Showboat Casino Hotel has a riverboat-themed interior, while the superextravagant Trump Taj Mahal boasts nine gigantic limestone elephants to greet its guests. It is easily recognised by the 70 bright minarets crowning the rooftops. If you're new to the roulette wheel, try Claridge Casino Hotel, which has low-stakes tables and is just one block west of the Boardwalk.
