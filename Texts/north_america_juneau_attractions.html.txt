 Attractions  On Friday evenings in the summer, musicians and other performers give free shows at this delightful waterfront park, which is good for a stroll and also a logical starting place for a city-center walk. Start at the park's kiosk, at the southern end of Egan Drive and get kitted up with a walking-tour map. It will lead you first to S Franklin St, a historical district that experienced renovation in 1985, when many of its early-1900s buildings underwent a major makeover into bars, gift shops and eateries. It's now a one-stop mob shop every time a cruise ship docks.  Among other attractions (some covered below), the tour also leads toward the Davis Log Cabin , which houses local relics and historical pieces, and then to the very unassuming state capitol, which may seem at first glance more like a high school than the Alaskan seat of government. Free tours are up for grabs.
