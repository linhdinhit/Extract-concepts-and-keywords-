 Off the Beaten Track  Vaxholm, about 35km (22mi) north-east of the city, is the gateway to the central and northern reaches of Stockholm's archipelago, so it swarms with tourists in summer. Despite that, it's a pleasant place with several attractions, and it's well worth a visit. The town was founded in 1647 and has many quaint summerhouses, which were fashionable in the 19th century. The oldest buildings are in the Norrhamn area, a few minutes' walk north of the town hall, but there's interesting architecture along Hamngatan too.  The construction of Vaxholm castle on an islet just east of the town was originally ordered by Gustav Vasa in 1544, but most of the current structure dates from 1863. The castle was attacked by the Danes in 1612 and the Russian navy in 1719. Nowadays, it's home to the National Museum of Coastal Defence.
