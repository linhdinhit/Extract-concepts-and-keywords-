 Activities  There are not many organised activities on Kiribati, so your best bet is to arrange your own diving or game fishing early. The underwater visibility is generally excellent and the underwater life is wild, whether you want to view it through a diving mask or on the end of a hook. Several companies hire gear and boats, and at least one large operation is based on South Tarawa. The surfing is reportedly great on Tabuaeran Island.
