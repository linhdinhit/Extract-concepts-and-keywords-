 Activities  What the Federated States of Micronesia lack in land they more than make up for in water. Some of the region's most spectacular scenery is underwater, and the traveller who never looks below the surface is missing out on some incredible sights. What's more, the balmy water temperature means you won't even need a wetsuit. Divers the world over know about Chuuk's underwater wreck museum; more than 60 Japanese ships, as well as numerous planes, were sunk here during WWII, and most are still as they were at the time they hit the bottom. There are also some shallower wrecks suitable for snorkellers. Diving off Yap is enlivened by its schools of manta rays.  There's not much space for walking in the country, but there's some decent hiking on Tofol, Kosrae. The hike to the top of Mt Finkol takes 8 to 10 hours, and is a strenuous climb through rivers and mud. When you get to the top you can see all three of Kosrae's islands. Pohnpei's jungle interior also makes for some pretty good treks.
