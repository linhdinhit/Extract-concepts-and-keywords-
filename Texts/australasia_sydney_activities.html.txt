 Activities  Sydney's sunshine, parks and can-do attitude add up to plenty of ways to get the heart-rate up. The harbour offers sailing, canoeing, and windsurfing opportunities. Spit Bridge and Balmoral are the best places to hire equipment. Good surf beaches include Bondi and Tamarama on the south shore and Narrabeen, North Avalon and Palm Beach on the north shore. Manly is the centre of Sydney's diving scene. The harbour beaches at Camp Cove, Nielsen Park, Balmoral and Chinaman's Beach offer picturesque swimming, but no waves. If you want to go bodysurfing, head for Bondi, Tamarama and Bronte on the south shore, and just about any of the beaches lining the 30km (19mi) stretch of coast from Manly to Palm Beach on the north shore. Or try one of the 100 public swimming pools; the Andrew 'Boy' Charlton is deservedly famous.  There are plenty of coastal bushwalks in the Royal National, Ku-ring-gai Chase and Sydney Harbour national parks. The 8km (5mi) Manly Scenic Walkway follows the harbour from the north shore beachside suburb to Spit Bridge on Middle Harbour. Another spectacular but much shorter walk is along the cliffs from Bronte to Bondi Beach. You can hire horses to ride in Centennial Park, the large park between Paddington and Bondi. The park vies with Bondi and Manly promenades as the favourite jogging and inline skating spot. There are also over 80 golf courses in Sydney, and plenty of tennis courts for hire.
