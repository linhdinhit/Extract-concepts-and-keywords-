 Activities  If you feel like a dip, pools in the major hotels can usually be used for a small fee, or you can check out the public pools at Balaju and at the National Stadium. Those who've left their trekking preparation until the last minute can drop by the Kathmandu Physical Fitness Centre for a workout, or maybe a post-trek sauna. Balloon flights take you above the pollution, and on a clear day it's a superb way to view the vast expanse of the Himalaya.
