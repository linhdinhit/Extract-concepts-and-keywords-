 Off the Beaten Track  The tiny old town of El Hatillo is a distant suburb of Caracas nowadays, but before becoming part of the capital's metropolitan sprawl it had happily gone its own independent way for centuries. Like most other Venezuelan towns, it's centered around its own Plaza Bol var, and has managed to retain some of its colonial architecture. The houses in the town center have been restored and painted in bright colors, and every second one of them is either a restaurant, cafe, boutique, art gallery or handicraft shop. Hordes of trendy caraque os descend on the village at weekends, and the resulting explosion of eating outlets has been extraordinary - you'll find most major foreign cuisines represented, from French and Italian to Japanese and Thai. El Hatillo is 15km (9.5mi) southeast of the city center, and is linked to Caracas by frequent carritos.
