 Environment  North Korea shares its southern border, obviously, with South Korea, and nuzzles up against China in the north and Russia in the far northeast. The country is slightly smaller in area than England, and just a few thousand square kilometres larger than its southern cousin. It faces Japan to the south and looks east across the Sea of Japan (known as the East Sea in Korea). North Korea is estimated to be 80 per cent uninhabitable mountains, compared to a mere 70 per cent uninhabitable land in the south.  When the Japanese were running the place they were no keen environmentalists, and used the whole peninsula as their own private timber mill and mine, especially once WWII kicked on. But much of North Korea's sheer inaccessibility saved it, and the northern and eastern regions of the country are mostly rugged mountains with dense forests, not well suited to agriculture or easy to exploitation. The Korean War and allied bombing in the 1950s took a huge toll, but much of the country is still shrouded in dense forests, with vast mineral wealth lying untapped below the surface. Estuaries and marshes teem with migratory birds and other wildlife, and if you manage to get out in the back blocks you may manage to see black bear or deer.  The weather is similar to South Korea's, only colder and drier in winter. Most of the rain falls from July to September, but autumn is drier with crisp, bright days and cool nights. The winters are long, frigid and noticeably lacking in ski resorts, making travel questionable at best. Summers are generally hot and sticky with lots of rain.
