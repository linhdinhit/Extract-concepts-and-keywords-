 Off the Beaten Track  Henderson Island is the largest of the four islands in the Pitcairn group. It is inhospitable to humans, but bird watchers are likely to get a big kick out of a short trip. The island was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 owing to its rare bird life and because its phosphate deposits have never been mined (a real oddity during a phosphate-hungry century). It lies 168km (104mi) north-east of Pitcairn, and is nearly eight times larger than it. Pushed up by three undersea volcanoes - Adams, Young and Bounty - two thirds of Henderson's coast has a new coral reef. Its 15m (49ft) high cliffs are the ancient coral reef, and the fossilised corals that the island is composed of bake under the sun and make climbing difficult, as they're sharp, hot and crumbly underfoot. The interior is covered by dense thickets of brush, but since Pitcairn has largely been cleared of its miro trees, islanders make infrequent trips to Henderson to harvest the remote stands still growing there.  The only land mammals on the island are Polynesian rats, but Henderson has four endemic land birds: the flightless Henderson rail (a type of wading bird, referred to as the Henderson chicken), the striking Stephen's lorikeet, the Henderson fruit dove and the Henderson warbler. Nine seabirds breed on the island and six other species have been seen there from time to time, and green sea turtles drop by occasionally to lay eggs. During some tides there is a freshwater spring in a cave at the north of the island. Shipwreck survivors last century found human skeletons in the cave. You can reach Henderson when Pitcairners visit, or via passenger or cargo ship.
