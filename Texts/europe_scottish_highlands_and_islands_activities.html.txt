 Activities  The Scots love their games, watching them with fierce, competitive dedication and identifying closely with teams and individuals competing both locally and internationally. The most popular games are football (soccer), rugby union, lawn bowls, golf (which the Scots claim to have invented), and the endemic shinty and curling. Shinty is an amateur ball-and-stick sport similar to Ireland's hurling. It's fast, very physical and played in winter. Curling involves teams of four propelling circular polished granite stones over ice as close to the centre of a target as possible.  Another popular activity, among locals and visitors alike, is walking. Scottish walkers are fiercely protective of their right to roam the mountains and moors, and legal rights of ways plus responsible access agreements to private property have resulted in a multitude of paths for enthusiasts to enjoy. These include the long-distance West Highland Way and Great Glen Way. Whether it is conquering Britain's highest mountain, discovering the isolation of the Highlands' moors or wandering along spectacular sea cliffs, the range of options is as varied as the landscape itself.  An unusual, and typically British, way to explore the Highlands' Great Glen is on the canal in a narrowboat - with all the comforts of home. Other activities popular in the region include cycling the quite roads of the majestic Highlands and mystical islands; diving, surfing or swimming (equipped with a wetsuit for anything more than a quick dip); skiing Britain's best snow resorts in the Cairn Gorm and Glen Coe areas; and birdwatching, particularly the nesting seabird colonies on Orkney and Shetland.
