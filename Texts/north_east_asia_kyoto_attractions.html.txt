 Attractions  The Imperial Palace was built in 794 AD and, after destruction by fires, has undergone countless rebirths. Ceremonies related to the enthronement of a new emperor and other state functions are still held here, and the palace is full of priceless treasures, including sliding screens adorned with Tosa school paintings. The hall was initially used as living quarters for the emperor, but was later set aside for ceremonial use only. Foreigners are given preferential access to the palace and can usually obtain permission to enter in a few hours (though sometimes it can stretch to two days), while Japanese visitors - unless accompanied by a foreigner as an interpreter - can sometimes wait months. Twice-yearly, in spring and autumn, the palace grounds are chock-full when the inner sanctum is opened to the public for several days.
