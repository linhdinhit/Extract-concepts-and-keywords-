 Activities  One of Uruguay's favorite pastimes is dancing the tango. No trip to Montevideo would be complete without a night out on the dance floor. Soccer is an absolute passion among Montevide os, having hosted the game's first ever World Cup in 1930 (which they won). Catch a game at the Estadio Centenario stadium between local rivals Atletico Penarol and Nacional for a truly scary sporting experience. For something less tribal, Montevideo has a lively theater community, while Afro-Uruguayan candombe music is popular, unique and sets the hips wriggling.
