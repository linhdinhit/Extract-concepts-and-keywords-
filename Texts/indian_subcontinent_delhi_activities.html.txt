 Activities  If you've got a dollar in your pocket, a Hermes scarf in your suitcase and you like mixing it with the city's elite, Delhi has sporting facilities to spare, including gyms, tennis courts and billiards tables. There's also a beautiful golf course at the Delhi Golf Club, but once again you'll need to be cashed up. Most of the major hotels have swimming pools, or if you've had your hepatitis injections you could take a dip in the public pool in the Talkatora Gardens.  Delhi isn't renowned for its water bodies, but if you're prepared to risk feeling silly you can hire a dinghy for a paddle in the pools along Rajpath, or you can take a pedal boat out on the Purana Qila moat. If that's not extreme enough for you, try the rock climbing on the artificial wall on Benito Juarez Marg, or the real thing at Lado Sarai adventure park.
