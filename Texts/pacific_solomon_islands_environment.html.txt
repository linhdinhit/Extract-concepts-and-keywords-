 Environment  Just to the east of Papua New Guinea in the South Pacific are the 992 islands that make up the Solomons. The third-largest archipelago in the region, the Solomons are made up of mountainous islands covered in tropical rainforests, entirely clear-felled islands and many low-lying coral atols. In 1997 there were an estimated 430,000 inhabitants, occupying about a third of the islands. While the country's biggest export, timber, has left over 10% of the landmass bare, the government has introduced a 'reforestation levy' on timber harvests. Although to date little of this revenue has been spent on actual reforestation, landowners are beginning to realise that bulldozing the rainforests isn't always the best way to use the local environment.  In addition to the blanket of rainforests, the Solomons also boasts coconut trees, scrubland and mangroves. Land mammals are mostly small and innocuous (though watch out for the ferocious wild pigs and the rats that are large enough to teach meddlesome cats a lesson). Reptiles thrive and seas teem: there are lizards, snakes, turtles and crocodiles, as well as stunning fish, including sharks, and even dugongs and whales. The Solomons have over 4500 plant species, including about 230 varieties of orchid. Many of the plants and trees are used by locals for building, food, medicine and clothing, but everyone avoids the large, purple-veined nalato leaf: it causes inflamation and itching.  While average temperatures on the tropical Solomon Islands are constant throughout the year at a shade over 30 C (86 F), rainfall varies enormously, peaking between January and April, the monsoon season. This is also the time you'll most likely encounter the annual cyclone or two. Humidity during this season commonly hits a stifling 90%, but in the afternoons and for the bulk of the year, the islands are fanned by mild south-easterly trade winds.
