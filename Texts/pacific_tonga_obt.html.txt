 Off the Beaten Track  Many Tongans from the more southerly islands know more about New Zealand or England than the Niuas, the farthest flung of Tonga's island groups. Tradition remains strong on the three islands, and the trip up is well worth it for the traveller, if not for the hypnotically beautiful beaches then for the friendly people who see so few tourists. You can climb the perfect volcanic cone of Tafahi, hike around the barren lava flows, swim in the beautiful Vai Lahi Lake on Niuafo'ou, and swim in the western waterways. Hihio is the sleepy capital of Niuatoputapu, and a plane from Tongatapu or Vava'u is the best way to get there. You must fly to Niuafo'ou as it has no safe anchorage, (from Tongatapu via Vava'u). You can reach Tafahi by boat from Niuatoputapu.
