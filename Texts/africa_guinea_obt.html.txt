 Off the Beaten Track  Sometimes called Mali-ville to distinguish it from the country, Mali is the highest town in the Fouta Djalon. It has cool temperatures and exquisite views, and is ideal for hiking. Mt Loura (1538m, 5044ft) is 7km (4.3mi) north of town and worth seeing, and so is La Dame de Mali, a legendary rock a few km further on.  Mali is 120km (74mi) along an unmade road from Labe, and you get there by bush taxi. It is about 400km (248mi) north-east of Conakry.
