 Off the Beaten Track  At the tip of Haiti's southern claw, Parc Macaya is the country's best-known national park, and rightly so. The mountains, criss-crossed with rough but beautiful trails, are covered in lush rainforest. The most challenging hike takes eight days round-trip, and the view from the top of Pic Macaya (2347m, 7700ft) is worth every blister. Guides are absolutely essential, and might even loan unprepared hikers a machete, necessary for hacking through the undergrowth.  There are two University of Florida campsites within the park, and both are extremely basic.
