 When to Go  It's hot and humid throughout Malaysia all year round, with overnight lows rarely sinking below 20 C (70 F) and maximums rising above 30 C (86 F) on most days, so whenever you go, take it easy. Rainfall is variable and falls all year round. It is rare for rain to fall all day: it usually confines itself to short-lived torrential downpours in the afternoons. The driest months tend to be June and July.     Events  With so many cultures and religions in Malaysia, there is almost always something going on. Visitors from Western countries will need to check the local lunar calendar for the exact dates of most events. New Year's Day, Chinese New Year, Worker's Day (May Day) and National Day (31 August) are just a few of Malaysia's mind-boggling 44 public holidays. The festival of Ramadan is the major Islamic event of the year.  The Hindu festival Thaipusam - now banned in India - is celebrated in the most dramatic way in Kuala Lumpur with devotees attaching heavy metal frames to their bodies using skewers and hooks. The celebrations centre on the Bata Caves.  KL is extremely well-serviced by air, bus and train routes. The main bus station - Puduraya - is just east of Chinatown, and services all of Peninsular Malaysia as well as Singapore and Thailand. Long-distance train journeys depart from the historic old train station, located 1km (0.6mi) from the new KL Sentral.
