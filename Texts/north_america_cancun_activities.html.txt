 Activities  Resort hotels, travel agencies and tour operators in the area can book you on day-cruise boats bound for snorkeling spots at the barrier reef and for other diving sites within 100km (62mi) of Canc n. If you're satisfied seeing the sparser aquatic life off Canc n's beaches, you can rent snorkeling equipment from most luxury hotels. Deep-sea fishing excursions can be booked through agents or hotels, or you can negotiate a deal with a fishing-boat captain at the Puerto Ju rez ferry dock. Also available for rent at various locations are kayaks, boogie boards and inflatables. Speedboats, instructors and equipment are up for grabs should you feel inclined to water-ski.
