 Off the Beaten Track  About 10km (6mi) northwest of Acapulco, Pie de la Cuesta is a narrow strip of land bordered by the beach and ocean on one side and the large, freshwater Laguna de Coyuca on the other. Compared to Acapulco, it's quieter, cleaner, closer to nature and much more peaceful. Swimming in the ocean at Pie de la Cuesta can be dangerous, however, due to a riptide and the shape of the waves. Laguna de Coyuca, three times as large as the Bah a de Acapulco, is better for swimming. Its smooth waters are also good for water-skiing; several clubs provide the equipment. Boat trips on the lagoon can take you to three islands, one of which is a bird sanctuary, or you can cross to the jungle where Sylvester Stallone filmed Rambo. Horse riding on the beach is also popular.  Pie de la Cuesta has many beachside restaurants specializing in seafood, and it's the traditional place for sunset-gazing (the name translates as 'foot of the sunset'). There's no nightlife, but the sunset atmosphere is a great precursor to an evening's partying back in Acapulco. Buses marked 'Pie de la Cuesta' leave regularly from La Costera.
