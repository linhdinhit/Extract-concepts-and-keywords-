 Activities   Trekking in Greenland is serious stuff. There are very few well-worn trails (most of them are dogsled routes that run across country) and you'll need to be physically and mentally prepared for the challenge. If you can handle the pace, Greenland offers some of the most spectacular hiking sceneries around. For those into serious mountaineering, Greenland has all the mountain you can handle and then some. There are also gentler ascents for first-timers. A trip into the belly of the ice cap is a must for most mountaineers. Dogsledging is offered by the tourist offices and can last for either a few hours or a few weeks. Skiing, particularly cross-country skiing, is becoming more popular every year. Although hunting can be put on the agenda, strict rules and regulations apply. Many species are protected and even dead trophies cannot leave the country: this means no polar bear throw rugs on the floor or caribou heads mounted on the mantlepiece back home.  Off the land there are plenty of watery activities going around. The Inuits invented kayaking, so it's only to be expected that it's high on the list of things to do. Both short trips and longer trips can be arranged, although both sort are subject to the dangers of rolling icebergs. For the avid fisherperson and angler Greenland offers unique fishing opportunities. Apart from regular angling, you can also fish the time-honoured Inuit way; through a hole in the ice. The hole-the-ice method has been known to throw up the odd shark, some of them as long as 6.5m (21ft).
