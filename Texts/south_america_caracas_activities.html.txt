Spectator sports include professional-league baseball at the university, soccer at the neighboring stadium and horse racing at the Hip dromo La Rinconada, 6km (3.5mi) from the center. Having indulged in the usual big-city activities, the best thing to do is to hit nearby Parque Nacional El vila for a spot of hiking. Local rock climbing fans flock to the Parque de Recreaci n Cuevas del Indio.
