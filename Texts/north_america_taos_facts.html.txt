 When to Go   Summer is the high season, coinciding with school vacations in both North America and Europe. Memorial Day weekend (end of May) to Labor Day weekend (beginning of September) is the vacation season; expect higher prices and more crowds.  The ski season in Taos and Santa Fe usually runs from Thanksgiving to Easter. August usually sees the Taos County Fair hit town, while October hosts the Taos Mountain Film Festival, first held in 2001. San Geronimo Day - 30 September though celebrations kick off the day before - is celebrated with dancing and food. It is one of the largest and most spectacular Native American celebrations in New Mexico.
