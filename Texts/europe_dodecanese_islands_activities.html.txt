 Activities  Windsurfing, water-skiing, snorkelling, diving and swimming are the activities de jour in the Dodecanese - what else would you do when you've got the warm azure waters of the Aegean rippling in front of you? Windsurfing is the most popular watersport in the whole of Greece. You'll find sailboards for hire all over the place, and if you're a novice, most outfits that rent gear also give lessons. Rhodes, Karpathos and Kos are the best places. Water-skiing nuts will need to head to Rhodes or Kos to get their fix. Make sure your insurance is up to date!   Snorkelling, on the other hand, is enjoyable almost anywhere, and the Dodecanese offer some of the best spots in the Greek islands. Strap on your mask and fins at Ammoöpi on Karpathos, Telendos Islet near Kalymnos, Lipsi and anywhere off the coast of Kastellorizo. Diving is a slightly different matter. To protect the many underwater antiquities throughout the Aegean, you can only explore the depths with a diving school. Luckily, Rhodes has one. If you can drag yourself away from the beach, trekking, or simply wandering the pathways around islands, is another option - in the right season. July and August are a recipe for heatstroke, but April and May are just perfect. Yachting is incredibly popular - the Aegean rivals the Caribbean for its perfect sailing conditions. Oh, and did we mention sunbathing, napping and generally lazing around on the beach?
