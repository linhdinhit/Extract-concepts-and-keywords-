 Environment  Belarus is slightly smaller than the UK and borders Russia in the north and east, Latvia and Lithuania in the north-west, Poland in the west and Ukraine in the south. It's a low-lying country, with the highest hill, Dzjarzhinskaja, reaching only 345m (1132ft). The terrain is mostly low ridges dividing broad marshy lowlands scattered with small lakes. The major river is the Dnjapro, which flows into eastern Belarus from Smolensk in Russia.  Belarus was once completely covered in forest. By the 16th century most of it had been cleared for farming, but great plots have regrown, especially in the south. The most common trees are conifer, oak, beech and silver birch. The Belavezhskaja Pushcha Nature Reserve, on the Polish border, is Europe's largest slice of primeval mixed forest and is home to a healthy population of European bison. Belarus' other nature reserves are home to elk, deer, boar, wolf, fox, squirrel, marten, hare, beaver, otter, mink and badger. Agricultural land is given over to grains and to flax (the raw material for linen): great fields of the delicate blue flax flower are a striking sight.  Belarus has a continental climate which becomes marginally more severe as you move from south-west to north-east. Average January temperatures are between -4 C and -8 C (25-18 F), and there's frost on the ground 7 to 8 months of the year. The warmest month is July, when temperatures normally reach 19 C (66 F). It's wettest in June and August, and there's snow cover from December to April.
