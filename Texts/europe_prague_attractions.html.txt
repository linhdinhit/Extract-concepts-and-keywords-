 Attractions  Prague Castle (Prazsky Hrad, or just hrad to the Czechs) may be the largest ancient castle in the world - 570m (1870ft) long, an average of 128m (420ft) wide and occupying 7.28 hectares (18 acres). It's the most popular tourist attraction in Prague, but at least there's plenty of room to spread out.  The castle has been the seat of Czech government since Prince Borivoj founded the first fortified settlement here in the 9th century, though current president V clav Havel has chosen to live in his smaller (and less touristed) home on the outskirts of the city.  Some of the complex's highlights, like the Spanish Hall and Rudolf Gallery, are only open one Saturday a year (usually in early May). The rest of the castle's collection of architectural and artistic marvels, created over the course of the last millennium, are on exhibit.  The most popular edifices include Gothic St Vitius Cathedral (1344), its rich decorations epitomized by the glittering Chapel of St Wenceslas; the Old Royal Palace (1135) and its jousting and coronation hall, still used for the swearing in of new presidents; and the Royal Garden (1569), where homesick Hapsburgs surrounded their badminton courts with beautiful flowers and striking Italian Renaissance residences.  Don't miss Prague Castle's less famous attractions, such as the network of tunnels the communist government built in 1950 for easy access to the bomb shelters. Other interesting artifacts include the Battling Titans statues (1767-70; Ignac Platzer), which oversee the hourly changing of the guards, and the Toy Museum, featuring one of the world's largest collections, with items dating back to ancient Greece.
