 When to Go  Unless you don't mind almost daily torrential rain, the best time to visit Chiang Mai is between October and April, with the other months a virtual monsoonal washout. It can be quite hot, with the April average temperature 36 C (95 F). The mildest temperatures are in December and January. Nights in Chiang Mai are regularly cooler than in southern Thailand. Festivals occur throughout the year, with the bulk of them between late December and April. These provide a great opportunity to immerse yourself in the colour and spectacle of traditional Thai culture.     Events  The week-long Winter Fair at the end of December is a great festival, as is the April Songkran Water Festival. The highlight of Chiang Mai's festivals, however, is the Flower Carnival in February, which features parades, floats, music and traditional cultural events.   Chinese New Year falls in late January or early February, and is celebrated throughout Thailand. Some other of Thailand's seemingly endless list of public holidays include Chakri Day (6 April), Coronation Day (5 May), Constitution Day (10 December) and several holidays celebrating the birthdays of current and former kings and queens.
