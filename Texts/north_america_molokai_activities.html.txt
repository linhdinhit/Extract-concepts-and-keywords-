 Activities   For those who believe that if a mountain is there, it should be climbed, Molokai is your place. For a place that presents itself as laid back, it sure has a lot of sweat-inducing activities. Swimming is always an option (it's an island!) but a lot of the Kaunakakai coastline is too silty for good swimming and some of the beaches surrounding Molokai are rough and dangerous. The southeastern end of the island has most of the swimmable beaches. Good snorkelling locations can be a little hard to find, but the waters off 20-Mile Beach in East Molokai offer some pretty fishes and a day of sun and sea. Molokai is particularly famed for its kayaking routes. You could kayak for weeks on end along the coast and across pristine reefs or remote valleys, but a note of caution: for some routes - through ocean swells and rough waves - are for experienced kayakers only. Hiking is popular through Molokai's lush valleys (fed by many spectacular waterfalls), beautiful rainforests, rugged cliffs and long beaches. If you get tired of all that natural splendour, there's also motorbike riding, tennis, and golf.
