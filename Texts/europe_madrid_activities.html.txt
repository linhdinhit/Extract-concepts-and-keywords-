 Activities  Madrid is synonymous with art galleries, bullfights, bar culture and alfresco dining. Still, you can get physical if you really want to - if you can find some time between hangovers. The city has various outdoor swimming pools, which open from June to September, and there are indoor pools for the rest of the year. In July and August a couple of big aquaparks open outside Madrid, too. The most extensive tennis courts are on the northern side of the lake in the Casa de Campo. You can play golf at various places, but Golf Park is conveniently open to all. Football is of, course, the favoured spectator sport.
