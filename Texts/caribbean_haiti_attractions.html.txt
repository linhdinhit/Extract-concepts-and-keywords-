 Attractions  Gingerbread trim and a view of the harbor are about all Port-au-Prince has in common with other Caribbean capitals. It's crammed with people soldiering on amidst rundown buildings, open sewers, brightly colored murals and the haphazard lurching and zooming of taptaps, public buses emblazoned with fine art and Creole sayings. Much of the activity is centered on the Marche de Fer (the Iron Market), a 19th-century iron and tin mix of Parisian class and African style. It's chaos inside, packed with stalls, vendors and piles of fruit, baskets, soap, religious totems and toys. It's hot, noisy and likely to overwhelm the faint of heart.  Good places to seek post-shopping repose are the Cathedrale de Port-au-Prince, where the decor owes as much to Africa as to Rome, and the Cathedrale de la Ste Trinite, where you can gaze up at murals by some of the country's most famous artists. The Musee d'Art Ha tien du College St Pierre has an excellent collection of paintings. The Musee National is more of a national curio cabinet, featuring King Christophe's suicide pistol and a rusty anchor reputed to have been salvaged from Columbus' Santa Maria. There are areas of the capital travelers should avoid, chiefly the shantytowns on the northern edge of the city.
