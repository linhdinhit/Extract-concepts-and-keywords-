 Off the Beaten Track  Leave the world behind and take a drive to the hamlet of Colombier. This short, pleasant side trip offers a glimpse of a rural lifestyle that has long since disappeared elsewhere on the island. The scenery along the way is bucolic, with stone fences, big mango trees, an old coconut-palm plantation and hillside pastures with grazing cattle. The road to Colombier begins just north of the turn-off to Friar's Bay.
