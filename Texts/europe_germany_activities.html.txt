 Activities  One in every three Germans is a member of a sporting club, so it's not surprising that the great outdoors is accessible to travellers too. Cycling is a favoured recreation, with many western German cities and the countryside boasting super-smooth cycling trails. Eastern German back roads can be great for cycling too. Lightly travelled and more interesting than the main highways, you could spend weeks wending your way from town to town. Hikers are well catered for with marked trails in the Black Forest, the Harz Mountains, the Bavarian Alps and elsewhere. The Alps are the most popular area, but the trails get crowded, especially during holiday periods. In winter, skiing, both downhill and cross-country, dominates the area. The Black Forest, although vertically challenged, is also popular for skiing, while the Harz Mountains are popular for cross-country skiing. Germany's rivers and lakes are great for boating, with cruises operating around Berlin and Potsdam, the huge lakes in southern Germany and the Baltic Sea. Sailing and windsurfing are popular leisure pursuits, especially on Lake Constance in the south.
