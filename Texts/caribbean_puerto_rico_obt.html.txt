 Off the Beaten Track  Since the US Navy stopped using the archipelago for target practice in the mid-1970s, this cluster of 24 scrubby islands 35km (22mi) off the coast of eastern Puerto Rico has experienced a more beneficial boom. The definition of traffic here is still sharing the road with another vehicle, but more and more travelers and locals are beginning to appreciate the charms of this sleepy backwater, drawn by its beautiful beaches and the fantastic snorkeling and diving offered by its coral reefs.  Culebra itself measures a modest 11km by 6km (7mi by 4mi), but it dominates the archipelago. The island's undistinguished main town, Dewey, contains most of the area's 2000 souls. Travelers should head to the northern coast to Flamenco Beach or to nearby Playa Resaca. The Culebra National Wildlife Reserve encompasses parts of Culebra and the outlying islands, protecting significant seabird colonies and turtle-nesting sites. You can visit the surrounding cays by chatting up the local fishermen or by arranging dives through local operators. There's a ferry to Dewey from Fajardo that takes an hour or so, and air connections to Culebra from both Fajardo and San Juan.
