 Off the Beaten Track  Bosra sits on a fertile plain littered with black basalt about 140km (87mi) south of Damascus. It once held pride of place on local trade and pilgrimage routes, but it has now sunk into obscurity. Despite this, it's a weird and wonderful place, built in, over and around old Roman buildings, like some sort of architectural strangler vine. The city is made almost entirely from black basalt, most of which has been filched from older buildings. It is also has one of the best preserved Roman theatres in the world.  The theatre is particularly unusual in that it was fortified and turned into a citadel. Nine towers were raised around the building and a deep moat dug to further protect it. Inside the citadel, you can still see the magnificent 15,000-seat theatre. When it was in use, the theatre was faced with marble and draped in silk, and during performances a fine mist of perfumed water was sprayed over the patrons to keep them comfy.  In amongst Bosra's shops and houses, you can also see the ruins of a nymphaeum, some baths, one of the world's oldest mosques, a 4th century monastery and a Nabatean gate. There's only one hotel in Bosra, and it's darn pricey, but you can get a direct microbus from Damascus or Der'a.
