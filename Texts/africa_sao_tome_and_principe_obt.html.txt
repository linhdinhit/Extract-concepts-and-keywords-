 Off the Beaten Track  This is a very small island and you can walk anywhere in a day. Because outside visitors are so rare, you'll attract a lot of attention from locals, who may follow you and expect a tip, although they will be friendly. Santo Ant nio is the capital, with similar architecture to S o Tome, if more run down. It is about the size of a large European village, and there are several reasonably priced pens os.  Air S o Tome e Pr ncipe has four flights a week between the islands, and there are infrequent ferries.
