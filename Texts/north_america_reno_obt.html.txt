 Off the Beaten Track  Along the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe, about 20mi (35km) southwest of Reno, you'll find a handful of lakeside communities that buzz with tourist activity. The excellent Lake Tahoe State Park spans most of the ridge along Lake Tahoe's eastern shore, and has some top beaches and lakes as well as miles of trails. Many of the beach spots are undeveloped, and you'll have to do a bit of asking around to find the best ones. Spooner Lake, at the southern end of the park, has the best facilities and the most park information. The lake is stocked with trout and has restrooms, picnic facilities and a cross-country ski area with 56mi (91km) of groomed trails, including one that goes around the edge of the lake.   Incline Village is an enclave of million-dollar homes and private beach clubs, with a lovely bike path that's good for a ride and a rubberneck. The Incline Championship Golf Course is one of the best on the lake, and Incline's Diamond Peak has several intermediate downhill ski runs. South of the village, Ponderosa Ranch is a worn-out piece of Western Americana. This is where Bonanza was filmed, and it's now home to a wild west theme park, with barns full of old props, a staged gunfight on Main Street, a petting zoo, a shooting gallery, and a 10-gallon-hatful of stores and restaurants.  If it weren't for the swarms of summer tourists, Sand Harbor, on the lake's northeastern shore, would be heaven. Two sand spits have formed a beautiful shallow bay with brilliant turquoise water and white sand beaches. Diver's Cove, a popular scuba spot, is at the northern end. There are lifeguards, restrooms, snack stands and boat rentals, and in summer the harbor hosts a reputable season of Shakespeare on the sand.
