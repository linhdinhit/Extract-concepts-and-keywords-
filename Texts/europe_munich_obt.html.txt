 Off the Beaten Track  You want palaces? Schleissheim's got plenty of 'em. Spectacular Neues Schloss Schleissheim follows the Versailles model of palatial excess, complete with vaulted frescoed ceilings and picnic-friendly grounds. The once-splendid Renaissance Altes Schloss Schleissheim is a reconstructed rump of its bombed-out former glory, housing a collection of Christmas cribs and Easter eggs. Schloss Lustheim has a stunning Baroque interior and a huge collection of Meissen porcelain. For something completely different, pop into the Flugwerft Schleissheim, the aviation branch of the Deutsches Museum, with aircraft from around the world. To get to Schleissheim, take the S-Bahn to Oberschleissheim, and follow the signposts for 15 minutes.
