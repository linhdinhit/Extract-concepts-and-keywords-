 Environment  Shaped a bit like a gourd, Sint Eustatius is only 8km (5mi) long and 3km (2mi) wide. The island is 60km (37mi) south of Sint Maarten and 27km (17mi) southeast of Saba. Mt Mazinga, better known as 'the Quill' (whose name is derived from the Dutch word for volcano), is an extinct volcano rising 600m (1970ft) above the southern half of the island. Cliffs drop straight to the sea along much of the shoreline and the island has precious few beaches. At the northern side of Statia there are a few low mountains, while the island's central plain contains the airport and town. Statia has few roads and is easy to get around. Oranjestad, the island's sole town, is just south of the airport.  Most of the island is dry, with scrubby vegetation, although oleander, bougainvillea, hibiscus and chain of love flowers add a splash of color here and there. The greatest variety of flora grows on the slopes of the Quill, which collects enough cloud cover for its central crater to harbor a rainforest of ferns, elephant ears, bromeliads, bananas and tall trees. The island also has 18 varieties of orchids, all but three of which are found on the Quill. There are 25 resident species of birds on Statia, including white-tailed tropicbirds nesting on the cliffs along the beach north of Lower Town. There are also harmless racer snakes, iguanas, lizards and tree frogs - along with the ubiquitous goats, cows and donkeys.  In January the average daily high temperature is 29 C (85 F); it averages a few degrees warmer in July and rarely dips below 22 C (72 F). Moderate rainfall is fairly evenly dispersed throughout the year.
