 Off the Beaten Track  Valley Forge was the site of the US Army's renowned winter encampment from 19 December 1777 to 19 June 1778, while the British occupied Philadelphia (then the capital of the new nation) during the War of Independence. Not a battlefield, the site is held as a symbol of bravery and endurance - 2000 of George Washington's 12,000 troops perished because of freezing temperatures, hunger and disease. Despite such losses, the army was reorganized and emerged to eventually defeat the British. The British withdrew in 1778 after the Articles of Confederation were approved by Congress and Americans made an alliance with the French. Important sights include the National Memorial Arch to the soldiers who endured that winter and the Monument to Patriots of African Descent, a bronze statue honoring the 5000 blacks who died in the war.  Valley Forge is 20 miles (32km) northwest of downtown Philadelphia. You can get there via a 40-minute bus trip from downtown; by car take the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) west.
