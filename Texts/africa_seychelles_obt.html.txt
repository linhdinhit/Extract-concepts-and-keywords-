 Off the Beaten Track  About 20km (12mi) from Mahe, Silhouette is a large granite island which rises steeply from its beaches to three high peaks. Visitors have described this island as eerie and mystical - it looks particularly dark and mysterious at sunset. Rumour has it there's pirate treasure in the hills - whether it's true or not, there are some interesting caves. The beaches on Silhouette are protected by a reef and are great for swimming, snorkelling, or lazing around developing melanomas.  If you're after something a bit more strenuous, take a walk to the top of Mont Pot a Eau to see the bizarre carnivorous pitcher plant. Along the track you'll see coco de mer palms and monstrous millipedes, slugs and snails.  You can get to Silhouette by helicopter from Mahe, or you can join a tour, arrange a package deal or charter a boat.
