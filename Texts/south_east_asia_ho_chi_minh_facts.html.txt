 When to Go  Being only 10.5 above the equator and between 5 and 10m (16-35ft) above sea level, Ho Chi Minh City is almost a template for tropical weather. Temperatures rarely vary from about 30 C (86 F), however the seven or eight month wet season can certainly make things wet, sweaty and generally uncomfortable. Heavy downpours can last for days on end, although the city is largely spared the devastation of typhoons that hit the northern areas on the country. The driest time is between December and April, when the humidity is mercifully down below 60%.     Events  The major event in Vietnam - celebrated with extra vigour in Ho Chi Minh City - is the Tet, or Lunar New Year, Festival. It's a time when the Vietnamese gather together and hope for the future. It's also everyone's birthday. Tet falls between 19 January and 20 Feburary and lasts a whole week in the south. Public transport often shuts down for several days at this time.
