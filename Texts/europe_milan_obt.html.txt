 Off the Beaten Track  This thriving industrial and cultural center on the banks of the Ticino river is probably best known for its prestigious university (alumni include explorer Christopher Columbus and physicist Alessandro Volta of 'volt' fame), but there are many reasons to make the half-hour trip from Milan.
