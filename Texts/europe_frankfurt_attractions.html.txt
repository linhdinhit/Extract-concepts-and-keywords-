 Attractions  Grab a gelati, join the throngs and head for the old market square, site of the first Frankfurt Book Fair way back in 1480. The square is lined with a stage set of ersatz medieval buildings that give only a hint of the architectural riches lost during WWII. The three step-gabled pink buildings on the northwestern corner resurrect the old (1405) town hall, or Römer, site of coronation celebrations during the Holy Roman Empire. Paulskirche, on Paulsplatz to the north, is fondly remembered for hosting the short-lived National Assembly of 1848. Further east, the Frankfurter Dom was one of the few buildings left standing after the bombing raids of 1944, and it was here that all those emperors were crowned.  To tune into the Carolingian vibe, visit the Dommuseum and excavated Historischer Garten (Historical Garden). For yet more history visit the Historisches Museum just south of Römerberg; there's the usual tribute to apple wine, but the highlight is the incredibly detailed model of 1930s Frankfurt, flanked by a model of the postwar city in ruins.
