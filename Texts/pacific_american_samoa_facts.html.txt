 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: No visas are required for travel to American Samoa, however US citizens must have proof of this status and everyone else must have a valid passport. You will also need an onward ticket. Citizens of independent Samoa require a permit to enter American Samoa.Health risks: In general, American Samoa is a safe, healthy place to visit, though there are occasional outbreaks of dengue fever and filariasis. If you're careful, you should have no trouble with food and water. Pago Pago has clean, pure water. Village water is a bit less reliable; you'd be better off sticking to the bottled stuff. Be wary of dehydration in the heat and ensure food is either recently cooked or washed with purified water to avoid nasty tummy upsets.Time: GMT/UTC - 11 hours.Electricity: 110VWeights & measures: Imperial When to Go  The best time to enjoy American Samoa - and especially the island's capital - is between June and September, when the chances of fine weather are a bit better. The risk of tropical cyclones (hurricanes) is reduced at this time, too.     Events  All of the US public holidays are observed in American Samoa, as are the major Christian festivals. The territorial holiday, Flag Day, falls on 17 April, and is commemorated by an arts festival, fautasi (longboat) races, singing, dancing, traditional sports and skills competitions, and extraordinary, long-winded speeches by political figures. White Sunday is like a national kids day. On the second Sunday in October, children dress in white and lead church services. Afterwards, they're the guests of honour at feasts served to them by adults. The subtly named Tourism Week takes place in early May, and features celebrations and traditional sports. In August the high point is the crowning of Miss American Samoa. Designed to draw more tourists to the country, the week's events aren't as big or as popular as independent Samoa's similar Teuila Festival.
