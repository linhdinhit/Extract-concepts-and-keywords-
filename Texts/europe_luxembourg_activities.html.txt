 Activities  With a nebulous network of marked walking paths and hiking trails, Luxembourg is both a hoofer's paradise and an escapist's hell. National routes are indicated by yellow signposts, while those marked by white triangles connect the hostels. Luckily, you need only to avoid the marked trails and turn your rambling toward the Ardennes region to get away from most of the madding crowd and find (some small amount of) blissful seclusion.  More pastime than passion for most Luxembourgers, bicycling is hardly the feverish lifestyle here that it is elsewhere on the continent. Still, bikes are available for rent in the larger towns and the capital.
