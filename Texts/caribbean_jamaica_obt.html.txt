 Off the Beaten Track  Cockpit Country is a dramatic, sculpted 500-sq-mile (1295-sq-km) limestone plateau in Jamaica's central west. The area is studded with thousands of conical hummocks divided by precipitous ravines. Light plane or helicopter excursions are the most spectacular way to get a sense of the area's scale and beauty, and given that no roads penetrate the region, this is often the only way visitors get to see the Cockpits. Virtually unsullied by humans, the area is replete with wildlife, a temptation for birdwatchers, nature lovers and spelunkers (the Cockpits are laced with caves, most of them uncharted). Most of the trails are faint, rocky tracks, often overgrown slave trails that you can only follow with the aid of a machete. The rocks are razor-sharp, and sinkholes are everywhere, often covered by decayed vegetation and ready to crumble underfoot. Never travel alone here, and don't underestimate how strenuous and hot it can be.  It's easiest to approach Cockpit Country via Montego Bay to the north, where buses and minibuses head to towns like Clark's Town and Windsor on the northern fringe of the wilderness area.
