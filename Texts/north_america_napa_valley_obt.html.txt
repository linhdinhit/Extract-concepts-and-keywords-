 Off the Beaten Track  The small town of Sonoma makes an excellent base for exploring the vineyards of Sonoma Valley, Northern California's other favorite place to get elegantly plastered. 'Slow-noma,' the locals' term for their relaxing, livable wine town, hints at the low-key charms of the Sonoma Valley. With its family-owned wineries and quiet rural back roads, the 'Valley of the Moon' (Jack London's literary name for the region) can be a more enjoyable place to wander around than the larger and more crowded Napa Valley.  The wine is just as good as Napa Valley's, but the wineries in Sonoma Valley are generally less crowded, and free tastings are still the norm. There are several wineries within easy bicycling distance of the town center. Valley of the Moon, Wellington and Kenwood are three top-quality Sonoma winemakers worth a visit.
