 Activities  There are lots of places in the Turks and Caicos Islands to sunbake and swim. Grand Turk has fine beaches at Cockburn Town, Waterloo and White Sands. Salt Cay has excellent sands, as does Providenciales at Grace Bay and Chalk Sound. The islands also offer some of the Caribbean's best diving and snorkeling, especially along the 'Wall,' which is the face of a 7000ft (2100m) trench separating Grand Turk and Salt Cay from East and South Caicos. South Caicos has great wall diving, and you're sure to see plenty of pelagics, including eagle rays, Atlantic rays and black-tip sharks. Salt Cay's best dive sites include Wanda Lust, known for its plankton-rich waters that attract whales and eagle rays; Kelly's Folly, a rolling coral garden; and HMS Endymion, a never-salvaged 18th-century British warship bristling with cannons that was discovered lodged in a coral canyon.  The islands have unsurpassed whale watching. You can spot humpbacks off South Caicos in January and February, and the Mouchoit Bank, south of Grand Turk, has the only known breeding grounds for North Atlantic humpbacks. The islands' unofficial and much-cherished mascot is JoJo, a 7ft (2m) male bottlenosed dolphin who's been swimming with tourists off the northern shores of Provo's Grace Bay beach and Pine Cay since leaving his pod in 1983.  Birdwatchers can find ospreys, sparrow hawks, barn owls, pelicans and frigate birds throughout the islands. There are colonies of shorebirds on many of the uninhabited cays. Flamingoes can be found on West, North and South Caicos; the Cuban heron can be spotted on the latter. Other activities include windsurfing at Grand Turk's North Creek, and horseback riding, parasailing and skydiving on Provo.
