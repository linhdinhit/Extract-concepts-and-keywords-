 Off the Beaten Track  Sandoy is the least rugged of the Faroes, but it boasts the country's only sand dunes and they make great hiking, especially around the west coast and in the roadless north-east. On the pass above the town of Skopun are two beautiful lakes, Nor ara H lsavatn and Heimara H lsavatn, both popular with trout anglers. You can do a wonderful trek west from Skopun to the Cliffs of Dj paberg. A longer and rougher walk takes you along the cliffs of the south coast to Søltuvik and on to Sandur, a village sitting on a small peninsula between two lakes, Sandsvatn and Gr th svatn, and two bays, Sandsv gur and Gr tvik. At the head of Sandsv gur, between the village and the mountain, is an area of sand dunes and a beach of black basalt sands. The Sandur Church has a fascinating history, and the site has been used as a parish centre since the 11th century. Archaeological remains show that at least six consecutive churches have existed on the site since.  The 'troll woman's finger', or Trøllkonufingur, is a much-photographed sea stack north of the tiny settlement of Skarvanes. There's no public transport to the rock, but it's an easy 4km (2.5mi) hike north of the tiny settlement of Skarvanes. Sk lav k is known as the home town of the Faroes' most renowned writer, He in Br . It's also the start of a scenic walk over the mountain Hei afjall to H sav k, one of the Faroes' most charming villages. It was settled very early in Faroese history, but never really gained importance after the Plague decimated its population in the 14th century. It has a lovely, dark sandy beach, and just north of town are the ruins of a 14th-century longhouse.
