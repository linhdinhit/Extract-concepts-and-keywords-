 Activities  Thailand's two coastlines and countless islands attract schools of water babies. Diving and snorkelling are particularly popular around Phuket, Pattaya, and the Similan and Surin islands. The islands of Chumphon Province, just north of Surat Thani, are less developed and the reefs here are practically undisturbed. Touring the islands and coastal limestone formations around Phuket and Ao Phang-Nga by inflatable canoe has become an increasingly popular activity. The typical sea-canoe tour seeks out half-submerged caves, timing excursions so that they can paddle into the caverns at low tide. Inland raft trips are available down the Mae Klong River in central Thailand in Kanchanaburi Province and on the Pai River in Mae Hong Son Province.  Wilderness walking is northern Thailand's biggest draw. Chiang Mai is the main centre for treks into mountainous areas inhabited by hill tribes, but there are also trekking areas around Mae Hong Son and Chiang Rai. Cyclists favour the flat terrain and lush river scenery of the Mekong River area in the north and north-east of Thailand.   Meditation study is a decidedly less sweaty 'activity' popular with many visitors to Thailand. There are dozens of temples and meditation centres dotted throughout the country which welcome sincere guests. Instruction and accommodation are free of charge, though donations are expected. There are centres which provide instruction in English in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, amongst others. If you'd prefer to direct your energies outward, tuition in Thai boxing is available in Bangkok and in Naklua, north of Pattaya. Be warned that the training is gruelling and involves full-contact sparring. Chiang Mai has also become a centre for classes in Thai cooking and traditional massage.
