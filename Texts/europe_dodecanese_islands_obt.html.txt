 Off the Beaten Track  If you really want to play Robinson Crusoe and escape the tourist hordes, hightail it to Kastellorizo. The most eastern of the Greek Islands, this tiny, rocky islet is just 2.5km (1.5mi) from the Turkish coast and 118km (73mi) east of Rhodes. Kastellorizo's remoteness has ensured it has a character all its own and that tourism is low-key. It doesn't have any beaches, but there are rocky inlets from where you can swim and snorkel in crystal-clear sea. If you remember the 1991 film Mediterraneo you'll have some idea of what to expect.   Kastellorizo Town is the only settlement on the island, but it is largely a ghost town - most people emigrated in the mid-20th century in response to oppression and war. Behind a lively waterfront lie backstreets of abandoned houses overgrown with ivy, crumbling stairways and stony pathways. The impressive Knights of St John Castle, standing above the Kastellorizo Town quay, is the island's signature monument. The castle's museum houses a well-displayed collection and from the top of the pile there are great views across to Turkey. Other monuments include a Lycian tomb with a Doric facade - the only one in Greece - and the monasteries Moni Agiou Georgiou and Moni Agiou Stefanou. The island's ancient capital Paleokastro is nearby. You can fly or catch a ferry between Rhodes and the island.
