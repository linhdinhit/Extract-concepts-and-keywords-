 Off the Beaten Track  A national landmark, Annapolis (population 35,000) has one of the largest concentrations of 18th century homes and public buildings in the country. Although the town has been the capital of Maryland since colonial times, no modern office buildings mar the skyline or the narrow brick streets, making this a great town for period dress-up games.  Annapolis Harbor has been home of the US Naval Academy since 1845, and its connecting tidal creeks shelter dozens of marinas where thousands of cruising and racing sailboats tie up. This concentration of recreational sailing vessels, probably the largest fleet in America, has earned Annapolis the title of 'Sailing Capital of the United States'. In response to the onshore appetites of the sailing crowd and the tourists who come to immerse themselves in history and the nautical scene, an extensive collection of restaurants, bars, and inns has grown up around the city's waterfront. Today, Annapolis has a well-deserved reputation as a party town.  Annapolis is 35mi (56km) south of Baltimore and an equal distance east of Washington, DC on the Western Shore of the Chesapeake. Buses run from downtown Baltimore or, if you've got your own wheels, take I-695 to Hwy 2S to Hwy 50W.
