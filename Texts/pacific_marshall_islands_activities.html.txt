 Activities  The Marshall Islands sit amid some of the world's most spectacular underwater scenery, and the traveler who never looks below the water's surface is missing out on some incredible sights. The water temperature is pretty warm year-round, so wetsuits aren't a necessity (some people wear them for coral-scrape protection, but they shouldn't swim that close to the coral anyway).  For natural attractions, Mili Atoll's waters boast some of the most pristine diving conditions in the country. Another popular site is Calalin Channel, which for all the right reasons has been dubbed 'Shark Alley.' Bikini and Jaluit atolls have some of the best WWII-era wreck diving found anywhere, with scores of warplanes, submarines and battleships to explore. Other good wreck dives are found near Kwajalein. Aur and Ailinglaplap atolls have excellent snorkeling, with a wide variety of tropical fish and corals, plus the odd sea turtle and shark.  Virtually all of the Marshalls have beautiful white-sand beaches, perfect for lounging in the sun even where the waters aren't the safest nor the most sanitary. Some of the best swimming spots are found at Ailinglaplap, Mili Island and Laura Beach at Majuro.  The islands' prime sportfishing catches include marlin, sailfish, yellowfin tuna, skipjack tuna, mahi-mahi and wahoo. Arno Atoll is famous for its abundant catches, as is Mejit, which also has octopus and lobster.   Birdwatchers will want to visit Bikar and Taongi (Bokaak) atolls, as they've both been tagged as potential national preservation areas. The latter was cited as being 'possibly the only example of a completely natural, unaltered, semiarid atoll ecosystem remaining in the world today.' Bikar has an especially large population of green sea turtles.  While in Majuro, you can also play tennis or go bowling, should the mood strike.
