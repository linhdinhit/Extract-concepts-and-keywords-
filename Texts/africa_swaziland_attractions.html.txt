 Attractions  Mbabane lies at the northern end of the Ezulwini Valley amid the lush Dlangeni Hills, and apart from stocking up on information and supplies for trips farther afield, it doesn't offer much for the traveller. The main attractions in town are the Mall, the New Mall and Allister Miller St, the main street, named after the first European to be born there. You can do your banking and get your supplies around here.  Just to the west of the town centre is Swazi Plaza, a large, modern shopping complex that makes a good landmark and houses the tourist office and a further range of shops. The Mbabane Market, at the southern end of Allister Miller St, is worth a visit for its authentic crafts and its prices, cheaper than those in South Africa. Internet centres are mushrooming in Mbabane. You'll find htem at the Omni centre; in the post office upstairs; and in the mall.  Mbabane offers a good range of accommodation, from the caravan park 10km (6mi) away in the Ezulwini Valley through to church hostel accommodation and hotels and inns scattered around town.Several good restaurants serve Portuguese food and there are also excellent Italian and Indian restaurants in the city centre. You can get good and relatively cheap African food, and there are several steak houses.
