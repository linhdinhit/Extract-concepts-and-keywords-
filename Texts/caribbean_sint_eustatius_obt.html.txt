 Off the Beaten Track  Zeelandia, 3km northeast of Oranjestad, takes its name from Statia's first Dutch settlers, who were from Zeeland province in the Netherlands. It's a nice spot for a stroll, though the dark-sand beach at Zeelandia Bay collects a fair share of flotsam and is not a good beach for swimming. You can find private niches by walking south along the beach towards the cliffs.  If you're up for a longer walk, a track from the main road leads north to the semi-secluded Venus Bay. There's no beach, but it makes for a nice hike, taking about 45 minutes each way.
