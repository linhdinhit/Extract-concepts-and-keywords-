 Activities  Covering 25 sq miles (65 sq km), Phoenix South Mountain Park is the largest city park in the US, providing over 40 miles (65km) of trails for hiking and mountain biking. There are also good views and scores of Indian petroglyphs to admire. The park is on one of the lower ranges surrounding the valley, with South Mountain topping the landscape at 2690ft (820m). It's situated about 8 miles (13km) south of downtown Phoenix.  Just in case you'd doubt the valley's cowpoke roots, there are almost 40 horseback riding outfits listed in the Phoenix yellow pages. Short rides, often combined with a country breakfast or barbecue cookout, are popular activities, and overnight packing trips can be arranged. And if riding the range doesn't sate the desperado in you, drop by the local shooting and archery ranges for a whiff of gunsmoke and quiverful of release.  Serious golf players probably already know that the valley, despite its desert digs, is a major American golfing center with about 100 greens - from 'pitch and putt' to PGA championship courses.  One great way to chill out in summer is inner tubing down the Salt River, which cuts through Phoenix just south of downtown. Several companies will give you information, rent tubes and provide shuttles to good places to begin your float. Tubing season is mid-April through September, and weekends draw crowds of people bent on cooling off and partying on.  Dozens of companies offer hot-air balloon flights over the valley. Flights usually lift off in the calm morning air, drift for about an hour and top off with a traditional champagne brunch.
