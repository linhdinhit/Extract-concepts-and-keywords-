 Activities  There are endless opportunities for bushwalking in NSW, with most national parks offering marked tracks or wilderness walking. Handy to Sydney, both the Blue Mountains and Royal national parks are popular, and if you're after a steeper climb try Kosciusko National Park, which has several breathtaking alpine trails. The extreme cliffs and crags of the Blue Mountains also create some challenging surfaces for rock climbing and abseiling.  The whole east coast is a surf safari, but tried and true hotspots are Coffs Harbour, Byron Bay and Noosa. If you want to carve up the slopes on a snowboard or just try skiing, make for the Snowy Mountains in winter. There's fantastic white-water rafting and canoeing at Coffs Harbour on the Nymboida River or on the upper Murray near Khancoban.  If that all sounds like too much, there's always whale-watching in Eden or the many grape varieties of the Hunter Valley for wine-tasting.
