 Attractions  Santorini (officially known as Thira) is regarded as the most spectacular of all the Greek islands. And no wonder - its submerged caldera (crater) alone is enough to warrant the spotlight, let alone its postcard images of whitewashed churches and bougainvillea-clad houses set against blue sea and sky. Santorini's spectacular caldera is a vestige of what was probably the biggest volcanic eruption in recorded history, believed by some myth-makers to have caused the disappearance of Atlantis. The island's violent volcanic history is visible everywhere you look - in black-sand beaches, earthquake-damaged dwellings and raw cliffs of lava plunging into the sea. Volcanic activity has been low-key for the past few decades, but minor tremors occur pretty frequently and experts reckon the caldera could bubble up once again at any moment. For lovers of impermanence and drama, no other place even comes close.  To get some background into this island's extraordinary history, head to the Megaron Gyzi museum of local memorabilia in Fira, with fascinating photos of the town before and after the disastrous 1956 quake. The Museum of Prehistoric Thira houses impressive finds from the ancient site of Akrotiri, destroyed in the 1650 BC eruption. Look out for the gold ibex figurine, found in mint condition in 1999 and dating from the 17th century BC.
