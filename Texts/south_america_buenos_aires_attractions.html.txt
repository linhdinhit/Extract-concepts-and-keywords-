 Attractions  It's not very often that a cemetery would feature as a tourist must-see, but the necropolis at Recoleta is an astonishing exception to the rule. Recoleta is Buenos Aires' ritziest and wealthiest neighborhood, with superb old mansions along the Avenida Alvear. Nowhere is this elitism better displayed than at the resting ground of the rich and famous at the Cementario de la Recoleta.  Within the grounds, the mausoleums and vaults contain the legacy of Argentina's aristocratic and turbulent political past; their ostentatious splendor is a sight to behold. The Iglesia de Nuestra Se ora de Pilar alongside the cemetery is a Baroque colonial church that was consecrated in 1732, and is now a major historical monument.
