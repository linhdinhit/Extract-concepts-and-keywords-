 Activities   Fishing for barramundi, a freshwater and saltwater perch that often grows over a metre long, is a popular pastime in Darwin. Sunset cruises of the harbour run most evenings. There are also boat trips at Adelaide River Crossing to see crocodiles jumping out of the water and grabbing pieces of meat held on the end of poles. There is bungee jumping on weekends at Wharf Precinct, and a parachute club at Batchelor, 85km south of Darwin. Darwin is a good place to organise bushwalking or 4WD drive tours of the Top End, Kakadu or the Kimberley.
