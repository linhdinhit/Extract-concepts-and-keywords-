 Attractions  Scottsdale historic district was built around the time of the town's inauguration at the end of the 19th century, and thankfully much of it has been preserved. It adds credibility to Scottsdale's 'Westernest in the West' claims, and moreover it makes a darn good point of departure for visitors to the city - and the best way to discover it is on foot. Shopaholics are well-catered for - Scottsdale's affluence attracts some pretty high-falutin' boutiques for a town so proud of its rough 'n' ready origins. Artists were coming to Scottsdale long before Arizona became a real estate developer's utopia, and Old Town Scottsdale is replete with dozens of art galleries catering to every taste and budget. If avant-garde or Native American art take your fancy, pull out the platinum card and pray those stock options pull through, otherwise some Western-themed kitsch art might be taking pride of place on your mantelpiece this Christmas. Architecture buffs who've come to Scottsdale as part of a Frank Lloyd Wright pilgrimage should keep an eye out for the school (dating back to 1909), now also the site of the Scottsdale Historical Museum.
