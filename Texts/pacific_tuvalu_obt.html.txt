 Off the Beaten Track  The most northerly and most populous of the outer islands, Nanumea was occupied by US forces during WWII. Evidence of their presence exists in the wrecks of several US landing craft and a B-24 bomber. With the consent of the pastor, you may also climb the tall German Gothic-style tower for a wonderful view of the atoll. Nanumea is 475km (295mi) from Funafuti, and accessible only by sea.
