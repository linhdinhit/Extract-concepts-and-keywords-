 When to Go  Cape Cod and the Islands (Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard) are time-honored summer holiday getaways. In July and August they come to life. From late September to early June, many of the Cape's towns go into hibernation, although there's usually places to stay and eat. Winters are wild and woolly, ideal for reflective walks and comfort food for those to whom the fantasy that they are the last people on earth appeals. Those who like to have their littoral cake and eat it, too, should plan their visit around the July and August peak - ideally, before Memorial Day or after Labor Day.     Events  The Figawi Race from Hyannis to Nantucket is the largest sailing regatta on the East Coast. The boats hit the water each May. Provincetown's Portuguese Festival in June is a highlight of the Cape social calendar and hard to beat for sheer merriment. In July, Native Americans congregate from across the country for the Wampanoag Pow Wow, a three-day celebration of Native American culture by way of tribal dances and events. Falmouth's Harvest Day is a fall highlight and over the Christmas period a stroll through the Cape's villages reveals them decked out in boughs of holly and other picture-perfect Yuletide paraphernalia.
