See how far you can get without touching a sidewalk by taking the downtown Skyway. Those who like to feel the wind in their hair as they locomote might like jogging along the Central Parkway or across the Suspension Bridge and back, or biking along the 22mi (35km) Little Miami Scenic River Bikeway. Other popular activities include horseback riding and inline skating.  Several city pools and YMCAs offer good swimming, or you can go canoeing down the placid Little Miami River.
