 Attractions  Other than Guam, Saipan is the most popular destination with Japanese tourists. In recent years this has made the island the fastest growing in Micronesia, with new golf courses and resorts popping up all around the island. Tourists and alien workers now outnumber the Saipanese, and the island has lost much of its Micronesian character. Still, Saipan has gentle beaches on its western and southern coasts, a rugged and rocky eastern coast, a hilly interior and dramatic cliffs on the northern coast. The island is about 14 miles (23km) long and 5 miles (8km) wide. A leisurely exploration of the island could fill all of a day.   Garapan, the largest town in the commonwealth, is booming. Leveled during WWII and resettled in the 1960s, Garapan is crammed with sushi shops, karaoke clubs and other operations that cater to Japanese tourists. If you can ignore the Japanese film crews shooting television commercials, the white sands and turquoise waters of Micro Beach are among the finest in the islands. Stretching north from the beach is American Memorial Park, which features a swamp-forest bird habitat and a picnic-table human habitat, along with memorials to the Americans who died in the US invasions of Saipan and Tinian and a one-room WWII Museum with displays of weapons, uniforms, gas masks, photos and other war paraphernalia.  Lace up your boots and hit the Laderan Tangke Trail, a short loop (2mi/3km) at the northern end of the island through the Marpi Commonwealth Forest. This well-maintained public trail leads through the sort of dense jungle not usually accessible to hikers. It also skirts the Laderan Tangke Cliff, where you can take in an ocean view, and along the way there are markers explaining the surrounding flora, fauna and geology. You might also see birds such as the rufous fantail or the bright red cardinal honeyeater.  The airport is at the southern end of the island, 8 miles (13km) south of Garapan.
