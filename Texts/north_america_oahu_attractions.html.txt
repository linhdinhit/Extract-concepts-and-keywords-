 Attractions  Honolulu ('Sheltered Bay'), the only city of any real size in Hawaii, was established in the early 19th century and now has a population nudging the 400,000 mark. Its considerable 150-year history as the state capital and beguiling multi-ethnicity can be fruitfully explored in the compact downtown area, a cluttered zone of historic buildings and skyscrapers that is unfriendly to cars due to the already heavy traffic and ultra-competitive parking environment, but a doddle for pedestrian explorers.  Downtown's prime historical attraction is Iolani Palace, a landmark reminder of Hawaii's royal bloodlines. Built in 1882 to serve as the regal residence of King Kalakaua and Queen Kapiolani, the palace became Hawaii's capitol (home of the state legislature) after the island kingdom was overthrown in 1893, and now welcomes tourists eager to see its carefully restored interior. A few blocks away is the oldest church on the island, Kawaiahao Church, built in 1842 using mighty coral slabs excavated from the local underwater reef. One of the several museums in the area worth investigating is the Hawaii Maritime Center, a harborside repository of seafaring stuff that includes the Falls of Clyde, reputedly the world's last intact four-masted, four-rigged ship.  Wafting over the downtown area from the north are the stomach-teasing aromas of the kitchens of Honolulu's frenetic, authentic Chinatown. Here you'll find a huge number of cheap Chinese restaurants, as well as practitioners of the Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino culinary arts. To prepare your own Chinese banquet, head for the innumerable food stalls of Oahu Market, where you can get everything from gingerroot to pig heads. To aid your digestion afterwards, wander through the tropical delights of the 14-acre (5.5-hectare) Foster Botanical Garden, planted by a German botanist in 1850.
