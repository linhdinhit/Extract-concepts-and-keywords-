 When to Go  Any time is a good time to visit Reno (especially if you'll be spending most of your time in climate-controlled casinos), although winter can get mighty chilly. Temperatures in July climb up to 90 F (32 C), while in January the daytime temperature is around 40 F (4 C). Snow is no surprise in winter - nevada means snowy in Spanish - but rain is far less frequent. If you want to avoid the hordes, keep in mind that school vacations are from early June to early September, and around Christmas and Easter. From Memorial Day to Labor Day prices will be higher and hotel beds will be harder to come by.     Events  Like any place trying to drum up its tourist trade, Reno has a full-to-bursting calendar of special events. Those that look most interesting are also those that pack the hotels, so plan accordingly. The Reno Rodeo, one of the country's largest, fills the Livestock Events Center with bucking broncos and bruised cowpokes from 17 to 25 June. Things heat up even more for Hot August Nights, a series of parades and concerts celebrating the cars and music of the '50s and '60s. At the end of August, the Nevada State Fair has, well, all the fun of the fair: rides, games and heaps of cattle. In September, Reno's skies come alive with the world's longest-running (flying?) airshow, the National Championship Air Races.
