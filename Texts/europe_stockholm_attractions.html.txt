 Attractions  The 'new' Royal Palace is one of Stockholm's highlights, and it was constructed on the site of the 'old' royal castle, Tre Kronor, which burned down in 1697. The north wing of the castle survived the fire and was incorporated in the palace, but the medieval designs are now concealed by a baroque exterior. The palace, with 608 rooms, is the largest royal castle in the world still used for its original purpose. The excellent state apartments, including the Hall of State and the Apartments of the Royal Orders of Chivalry, are open to the public (except during state functions), with two floors of royal pomp, 18th- and 19th-century furnishings and portraits of pale princes and princesses. Swedish regalia, crowns, scepters, orbs and keys are displayed at the Royal Treasury, by the southern entrance to the palace and near the Royal Chapel. Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities displays the Mediterranean treasures (particularly sculpture) acquired by that eccentric monarch.  The new basement Museum Tre Kronor, opened in December 1999, features the foundations of 13th-century defensive walls and exhibits rescued from the medieval castle during the fire of 1697. The Changing of the Guard usually takes place in the outer courtyard at 12:10pm daily June to August. The rest of the year it's on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday only.
