Summer lasts roughly from June to September and offers the most pleasant climate for outdoor pursuits. Unfortunately, you won't be the only tourist during this period, so prices can be high. You'll find much better deals during the shoulder seasons of April-May or late-September-October.  If you're keen on winter sports, resorts in the Alps begin operating in late November, move into full swing around Christmas, and close down when the snow begins to melt in April.     Events  Look out for processions and fireworks on 15 August, Liechtenstein's national holiday.
