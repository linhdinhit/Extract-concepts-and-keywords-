 Activities   Canoeing is a mightily popular local activity, be it on the Hillsborough River or in the warm Gulf waters at nearby Clearwater Beach. Cyclists are a common sight around town, with various events and riding groups regularly organized: many public buses are equipped with bicycle racks. Ice skating is possible year-round at Town & Country Skateworld with the admission price including skate-hire, while anyone into friendly fire can try paintball at the Thunderbay Paintball complex. Meanwhile, one-hour hot air ballooning tours are conducted over the city at dawn each day (depending on the weather) and period-garbed actors lead ghost tours on foot through Ybor City.
