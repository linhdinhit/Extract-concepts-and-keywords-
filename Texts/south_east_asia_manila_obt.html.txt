 Off the Beaten Track  This small island at the mouth of Manila Bay was the site of the US-Filipino last stand against the invading Japanese. The island certainly didn't turn out to be as impregnable as the defenders thought, but they did hold out for a considerable time. Now the island is a national shrine. Visitors can look around the network of underground bunkers and inspect the rusty relics of the old fortress armaments. The MV Sun Cruiser ferry to Corregidor leaves at 8 am daily from the dock near Manila's cultural centre. An extra service operates on weekends. The island is about 50km (30mi) from the capital across the Bay of Manila.
