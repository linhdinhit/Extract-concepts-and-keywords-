 Activities  Just walking around Santa Fe can be quite strenuous because of the 7000ft (2134m) elevation. Spend a day or two here to acclimatize before rushing off into the mountains of the Santa Fe National Forest, immediately to the east of town. The heart of the national forest is the undeveloped Peco Wilderness, with trails leading to several peaks over 12,000 feet (3658m). The trails are usually closed in winter.  In winter you can ski at the world-renowned Taos Ski Valley or cross-country ski in the Jemez Mountains and Santa Fe National Forest. Other blood-pumping activities include white-water rafting,fly fishing, rock climbing, mountain biking and swimming, all within minutes of the city. Numerous companies are eager to offer guided tours and rent equipment.  In Santa Fe itself, the main activity is shopping. Native American jewelry (predominantly of silver and turquoise), basket work, pottery and textiles are for sale at about every other store, as well as along the Palace of the Governors and in the plaza.
