 Off the Beaten Track  Port Sunlight is a Victorian chocolate-box village created by the philanthropic William Hesketh Lever to house his soap-factory workers in healthy, garden surrounds. The purpose-built village has an almost perfect collection of English vernacular, Arts & Crafts architecture (barring the odd satellite dish and high incidence of double-glazing). Other than wandering around the idyllic streets of mock-Tudor houses, gawping at the flower beds and remembering that people actually live here, the main attraction is the wonderful Lady Lever Art Gallery. Its prized collection of Pre-Raphaelite art vies with that of the nearby Walker Art Gallery, making Merseyside the mother lode of Pre-Raph art. There's also a pretty good range of Wedgwood pottery on view. The Heritage Centre tells the story behind Port Sunlight's creation. The village is a 20-minute train ride southeast of Liverpool, across the Mersey on the Wirral Peninsula.
