 Attractions  Let's face it, Isla Canc n is one big beach and there's no use pretending that there's anything else to do here. It's a lazy, beautiful stretch of white sand. The only thing you need to know is that the beaches on the western side face Laguna de Nichupte and are straitjacket-calm and those on the eastern shore face the Caribbean and are prone to fierce undertows. Isla Canc n is 23km (14mi) long, not very wide and known as the Zona Tur stica. The island is connected to Ciudad Canc n by two bridges.
