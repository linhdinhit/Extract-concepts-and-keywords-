 Off the Beaten Track  The small town of La Foa is surrounded by lush cane fields and beautiful blackwood and araucaria pines. The town has seen its share of troubles, from its earliest days as a penal settlement through to the shooting of two FLNKS leaders in 1985. The historic Paserelle de Marguerite bridge was designed by two students of Gustave Eiffel, and although it's been superseded by a wider bridge it's still an impressive construction. Fort Teremba, which sits on the plain overlooking Baie de Teremba, was headquarters for the local colonial military and was besieged by Kanaks in 1878 during the great insurrection. It is now used to stage sound and light shows in November. Farino, 3km (1.8mi) from the main road turnoff, has great views over La Foa and out to sea, and sports a popular market, held on the second Sunday of the month. Buses make the 110km (68mi) journey from Noumea to La Foa weekdays.
