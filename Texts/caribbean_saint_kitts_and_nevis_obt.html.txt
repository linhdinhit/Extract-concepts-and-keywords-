 Off the Beaten Track  Despite being Nevis' largest town and commercial center, Charlestown is a sleepy backwater. It has a good collection of colonial buildings, several of which now house museums, making the town a good place to absorb local history. The Museum of Nevis History occupies a Georgian-style building at the site where American statesman Alexander Hamilton was born in 1757. In addition to portraits of Hamilton, the museum has period photographs and other examples of Nevis culture and history. Another European figure is honored at the Horatio Nelson Museum. Nelson stopped off on Nevis in the 1780s, fell in love with the niece of the island's governor and married her. The collection consists largely of mugs and dishes painted with Nelson's image, ceramic statues of the admiral and a few everyday items once used by Nelson.  A short walk south of the town center is a small and largely forgotten Jewish cemetery, which consists of a grassy field with horizontal gravestones. The oldest stone dates from 1684 and quite a few others date from the early 1700s, when an estimated 25% of the non-slave population on Nevis was Jewish. The Bath House, a 15-minute walk south of Charlestown center, is a defunct hotel dating from 1778 that sits above thermal springs. Thought to have regenerative qualities, its mineral-laden waters were the island's main attraction in colonial days, when wealthy visitors flocked here to soak in the warm baths.
