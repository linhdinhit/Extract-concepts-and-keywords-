 Off the Beaten Track  The Dutch-French border slices straight across Oyster Pond, a largely rural area with a number of small condominiums and other vacation rentals. A marina and most of the accommodations fall on the French side. Oyster Pond isn't actually a pond but a protected bay whose shape resembles an oyster. For a good vantage of Oyster Pond, there's a short path leading up the cactus-studded hill on the northeast side of the bay.  The area's finest beach, Dawn Beach is on the Dutch side and features white sand and clear turquoise waters. Though it's a bit silted, swimming and snorkeling are good when the seas are calm.
