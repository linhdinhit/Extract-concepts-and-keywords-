 Off the Beaten Track  This is the beautiful farmhouse where Karen Blixen, author of Out of Africa, lived between 1914 and 1931, until she left Kenya after a series of personal tragedies. Nearby are the Ngong Hills, where many white settlers set up farms and built their houses. Passing by this area, you can be excused for imagining you are in the Home Counties of England, which along with the cooler temperatures goes a long way to explain why the Eureopeans settled here in such numbers. Though the hills offer some excellent walks, you should only do one with an organised tour or an armed escort, due to the risk of being mugged. The Karen Blixen Museum is a 40-minute bus ride southwest of town.
