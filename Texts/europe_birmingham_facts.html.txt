 When to Go  Birmingham doesn't have a peak season as such. The main theatres shut for the summer, but all other attractions remain open. Large conventions and exhibitions run year-round, and accommodation can be harder to find at these times. As a rule if you go between May and September you're more likely to get blue skies than during the colder winter months, but, as any Anglophile knows, the heavens could open at any time.     Events  Many events take place in the city itself. May sees the mad colours and atmosphere of Gay Pride take over the streets. The Latin American Festival and the Birmingham International Jazz Festival have events all around the city in July. In August Fireworks Fantasia, with the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, lights up the sky above Cannon Hill Park. On the last weekend in August is Party in the Park, which welcomes chart-topping bands in aid of the Prince's Trust. September's Artsfest, with over 200 free events in the performing and visual arts, is the highlight of the cultural calendar. The city celebrates its multicultural society with Sikh, Muslim and Hindu festivals throughout the year.  Birmingham also plays host to popular shows such as canine competition Crufts (March) and the BBC's Good Homes Show(May), Gardeners' World Live(July) and Good Food Show(November), when creative interior designers, green-fingered artistes and cult cooks will answer your queries and offer advice. The British International Motor Show attracts crowds in October. In December the Clothes Show features fashion shows and talent spotters: get your stilettos out, girls. Sports fans note that the Edgbaston cricket ground just outside the city usually hosts a One Day Cricket International in either June or July.
