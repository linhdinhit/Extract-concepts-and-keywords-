 Activities  Audubon Park is an ideal in-line skating area just west of the Garden District along the banks of the Mississippi. You can circle the park or concentrate on speed near the river in adjacent Levee Park, where you are less likely to crash into other park users. Lakeshore Park, a 10 mile (16km) narrow shoreline strip fronting Lake Pontchartrain, is also a great place to blade with long, paved trails. Skates are available for rent near both parks.  New Orleans is a great city for biking - it's flat and compact - just watch out for those hungry potholes that swallow skinny tires. A better bet is to hop on a fat-tire mountain bike - the perfect urban swamp cruiser. Casual bicycling is done in City Park, around the lakefront and on the bike trail around Audubon Park and Levee Park. For long-distance rides and tours, make sure you're well prepared for rain.  The good news for anglers is that Louisiana's commercial live catch leads the nation. Freshwater fishing is also appealing as the warm inland waters are incredibly productive habitats for catfish, sacalait (white perch) and bass. Casual anglers can try for the catfish and sacalait in Bayou Metairie at City Park. There's no equipment rental, but cane poles are sold cheaply at the boat rental near the Casino Building. Inexpensive daily fishing permits are required.
