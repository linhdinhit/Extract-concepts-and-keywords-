 Attractions  The rest of Los Cabos may be dominated by modern, all-credit-cards-accepted resorts and the mock-formality of golf course clubhouses, but the county's capital has chosen to keep its historic Spanish-colonial atmosphere, laidback friendliness and natural tranquillity. These relaxing characteristics are all on show in and around the distinctly uncluttered Plaza Mijares, a breezy square where inactivity rules supreme. Looming prominently on the western side of the plaza is the mosaic-decorated Iglesia San Jose, a replica of the cornerstone Jesuit misi n built here in 1730.  The plaza's perimeter is home to some fine restaurants where mooching pedestrians can get their fill of Mexican cuisine, from mariscos (seafood) to antojitos (traditional snacks). Also scattered around the square are numerous souvenir shops that sell all the usual Baja trinkets, like black velvet paintings, gaudily stitched super-size sombreros and wrought-iron cages containing domesticated wildlife (OK, stuffed birds). But among these are several shops selling the genuine craft and interior-design articles, such as artful ceramics, glassware, woven rugs, silver jewellery and sculptures from the mainland Mexican Huichol tribe. Running from the southeast corner of Plaza Mijares all the way to the main beach is Boulevard Mijares, where you'll find more emporiums and this low-key town's handful of gringo-frequented boozers.
