 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: All foreign nationals need a visa to visit Eritrea and these should be obtained from one of the country's embassies or consulates before you leave your home turf. Tourist visas are single-entry only and valid for a month - to get one, you'll need a passport valid for at least three months and one passport photo. Transit visas, for which you need a valid passport and visa plus an onward ticket, limit your visit to a week and can be arranged at an official Eritrean port of entry if need be.Health risks: Being by the Red Seaside and anywhere else that's less than 6500ft above sea level means being exposed to the risk of malaria, so stock up on the requisite drugs. Dengue fever is also endemic so anti-mosquito precautions are a must. Other common ailments in the region include diarrhoea, giardia, dehydration and worm infestations.Time: GMT/UTC + 3 hours.Electricity: Both 110V and 220V at both 50hz and 60Hz ACWeights & measures: Metric When to Go  In terms of climate, the worst time to visit Eritrea is June through August, when the rainfall is at its highest in the highlands and the west, and when the eastern lowlands are sun-baked to within an inch of their geographical existence; the best times are from March to April and September to October.
