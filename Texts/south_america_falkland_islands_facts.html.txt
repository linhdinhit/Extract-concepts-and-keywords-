December and January are the best months for wildlife watching, as the extended daylight hours provide ample viewing time as well as opportunity for other outdoor activities. However, December and January are also the wettest months, though rain falls throughout the year. October through April is the peak tourist season, but that's not saying much.  Annual sports meetings are the islands' other 'wildlife' attraction, with events including horse racing, bull riding and sheepdog trials. Stanley's sports meetings take place December 26th-27th, while camp sports are usually held in late February. Sea trout season runs from September through April, with the best fishing starting in late February.     Events  The Falklands celebrate a fair number of holidays, but the wildest event you're likely to encounter - aside from a parade of nude sheep just after shearing season - is the annual sports meetings held every summer on both of the main islands. The festivities take place in Stanley on 26 and 27 December and on West Falkland in late February or early March. Other than that, look for events on and around the Queen's Birthday (21 April), Liberation Day (14 June), Falklands Day (14 August), the Battle of the Falklands remembrance day (8 December) and for major western holidays like Christmas, New Year's and Easter.
