 Activities  Mozambique has great potential for anybody keen on wild animals or hiking (or both), but, tragically, the presence of nearly a million land mines in national parks and mountain areas (and throughout much of the country) means these activities aren't yet available.  The safest bet is diving or snorkelling, and the best places to go down are the beaches at Wimbi, in the north, or Tofu and Barra or the Bazaruto Archipelago, which has great reefs. Birdwatching is popular in Mozambique, especially in the southern part of the country. The Maputo Elephant reserve, located on the ocean, is a good spot for birdspotting.
