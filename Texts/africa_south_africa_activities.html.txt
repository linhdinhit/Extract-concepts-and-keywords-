 Activities  Active bods will have no trouble wearing out their sneakers in South Africa: the country offers everything from ostrich riding to the world's highest bungee jump! There are excellent hiking trails, usually with accommodation, although the intrepid might find them a bit overpopulated. Mountain biking is getting more popular and it's even possible to cycle through some of the wildlife parks. If that sounds a bit hairy, it's easy to plan safaris in South Africa's national parks and reserves. Airborne pursuits are popular: hang-gliding is a buzz off Table Mountain and there are ballooning and parachuting operators at the beach resorts. South Africa isn't known for its rafting and canoeing - it's more floating through landscape than testing out your life jacket - but there is some beautiful desert wilderness to glide through on the Orange River in the far north. Bird-watchers and flower sniffers love it here: for diversity, colour and sheer quantity, it's hard to beat. South Africa also has some of the best, least-crowded surfing in the world. Most surfers will have heard of Jeffrey's Bay, but the east and south coasts tube right the way along.
