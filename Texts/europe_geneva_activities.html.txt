 Activities  Being anywhere around the Swiss Alps on a lake means there is no shortage of year-round activities, and Geneva is no exception. There is an excellent walking tour of the old town from the Mont Blanc tourist office or you could take in the beautiful vistas with some hiking in the nearby Jura mountains or Mont Saleve to the southeast. During the summer months the lake provides plenty of opportunities for swimming and sailing.
