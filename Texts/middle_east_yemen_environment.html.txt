 Environment  Yemen is bounded to its north by Saudi Arabia, and to the east by Oman. A narrow strip of land, called the Tihama, runs along the coast - to its west the country's highest mountains rise to well over 3000m (9840ft) then slope away to a high fertile plateau. In these high areas you can still find active volcanoes and hot springs. The sands of the great Arabian desert pour into the country from the north and stretch down to the southern coast. Two-thirds of Yemen is uninhabited.  Yemen's flora and fauna have been all but wiped out by the combination of over-cultivation, deforestation and desertification. Along the Tihama, vegetation runs from salt-loving mangroves to sand-dwelling grasses and shrubs. More rain falls in the foothills, and a few evergreen plants such as palms and acacias grow there. Tropical plants grow in the mountains' higher reaches, including commercial plantations of tropical fruits, while the highest slopes have been cultivated by coffee and qat growers. The plateaux have been turned over to sorghum, vegetable and spice growers. About the only creatures you're likely to see are birds migrating to and from east Africa.  Yemn is the least sandy place on the Arabian peninsula, thanks to the the twice-yearly monsoon winds which dump huge quantities of water on the country. The wet season runs from March to May and from July to August, while the highest temperatures are between June and August. The Tihama and the southern coast are hot and humid throughout the year but without much rain - daytime temperatures are around 32 C (60 F) in winter, 40 C (104 F) in summer. The highlands are much milder, and San'a averages daytime temperatures between 25 C (77 F) and 30 C (86 F) - at night it can get down to freezing. Most of the rain falls in the western mountains between July and August, while no rain ever falls in the desert.
