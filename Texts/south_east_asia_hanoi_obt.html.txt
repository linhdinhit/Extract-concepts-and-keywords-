 Off the Beaten Track  This complex of pagodas and Buddhist shrines built into the limestone cliffs of the Huong Tich Mountains (Mountains of Fragrant Traces) is accessible only by water. Among the better known sites here are the Thien Chu (Pagoda Leading to Heaven), Huong Tich Chu (Pagoda of the Perfume Vestige) and Giai Oan (Purgatorial Pagoda), where the faithful believe dieties purify souls, cure illnesses and grant offspring to childless couples.  Vast numbers of Buddhist pilgrims make their way here during the early spring, where they spend their time praying, boating, hiking and exploring the caves. Despite the sometimes numerous visitors, the Perfume Pagoda is a peaceful, perhaps holy, place.
