 Activities  Parc du Banco in Abidjan is a great place for walking. You can trek through virgin rainforest in Ta National Park, located in the south-western corner of the country. The hiking is good on tall Mt Tonkoui and steep La Dent de Man in the central-western Man region. The best coastal areas lie west of Abidjan. Grand-Lahou is one of the best spots in the country for surfing. There are also big waves further west at Plage Le Bivouac in Sassandra; the swimming is better at adjacent Poly-Plage. The country's best beaches for sun worshipping are in Grand-Bereby, a fishing village 340km (210mi) west of Abidjan near the Liberian border.
