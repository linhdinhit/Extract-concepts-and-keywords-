When to Go  If you want to avoid the rainy season (August to November) and the hurricane season (June to October), Anguilla is best visited in the winter - when prices are highest. In the summer months (June to August) the weather is wetter and hotter, and the costs are lower.     Events  There's an annual Anguillian Cultural Festival in February. Moonsplash is an annual reggae festival held in March in Rendezvous Bay. But the big party in Anguilla is Carnival, a week-long festival that begins the weekend prior to August Monday (the first Monday in August). Carnival includes costumed parades, music and dancing. If you tire of shaking your booty you can cheer on the locals as they buffet the waves with their fishing boats during Race Week, which is held at the same time as Carnival.
