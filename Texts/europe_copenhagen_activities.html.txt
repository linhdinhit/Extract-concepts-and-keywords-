 Activities  Despite its northern locale, Copenhagen's abundance of water means windsurfing, sailing, canoeing and swimming are all popular and easy to participate in. Beachy types with antifreeze in their veins might want to try Amager Strandpark, a popular spot on the shoreline to the city's south - it's only a short jet blast from the international airport, though, so don't expect to hear only the sounds the sea. Other beaches include Sydstranden, also in Amager but a little further south from Strandpark, and Charlottenlund and Klampenborg to the north of downtown. A number of urban swimming pools and saunas are also open to the public.  Cycling in Copenhagen is incredibly popular - and dead easy; there are excellent cycling lanes and paths, lots of bicycle racks and the city's as flat as a pancake. Green, clean Copenhagen is also a good city for a long stroll, particularly along the main north-south thoroughfare of Øster Voldgade, which is lined with a number of pleasant gardens. The botanical highlights include Kongens Have (King's Gardens), Botanisk Have (Botanical Garden) and Ørstedsparken. There are also plenty of places to play golf, badminton and squash, and to ice skate.
