 Off the Beaten Track  Hobart is dominated by the 1270m (4165ft) Mt Wellington. There's a web of walking tracks over and around the summit, and the views (when the lowering fog allows) are fabulous. There's no public transport to the top of the mountain, but you can get buses to Ferntree, one of Hobart's outer suburbs, and do the return walk to the summit in about six hours. Organised bus tours run all the way to the top. It's always cold at the top of Mt Wellington, even at the height of summer, so bring a cardie (or a pullover, if you prefer).
