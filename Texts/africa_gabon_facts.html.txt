 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: All visitors need visas, proof of onward travel and an invitation from a resident or citizen of Gabon (though these last two requirements may be waived at embassies in adjoining countries). Gabonese authorities rejected some valid visas on a seemingly arbitrary basis during the elections in December 1998; this practice may still be in effect.Health risks: Cholera, yellow fever, malariaTime: GMT/UTC plus 1 hourElectricity: 220V, 50HzWeights & measures: Metric When to Go  The best time to visit Gabon is during the dry season (May to September). The rest of the year is one muggy, scorching hot day after another, with heavy rain from evening till morning.     Events  The biggest celebration of the year is the three-day Independence Day bash, with festivities more evident in the towns and villages than in Libreville. Muslims in Gabon celebrate the major Islamic holidays, including Ramadan, a month of fasting from sunrise to sunset. Eid al-Fitr celebrates the end of Ramadan with a feast, beginning on the evening of the 30th day. The centre of attention is usually a roasted sheep or goat. Also known as Eid al-Adha or the Great Feast, Tabaski is the most important celebration for Muslims in Gabon. They kill a sheep to commemorate the moment when Abraham was about to sacrifice his son in obedience to God's command, only to have God intercede at the last moment and substitute a ram instead.
