 Activities  Moscow is a snowy place, and its sports are appropriately snow-centred. There are a number of parks in the city where you can do a little cross-country skiing, or if you're keen for speed there are a couple of downhill runs just outside the city. You'll feel like a real Muscovite if you strap on your skates and hit the ice on one of the city's many outdoor skating rinks - you might have to bring your own skates, as rentals are a bit hard to come by. Public swimming pools are a tad tricky, as you have to have a doctor's certificate saying you're healthy enough to take the plunge. Chaika Swimming Pool offers a check-up on the spot, or head to Transvaal Park entertainment and water park. On hot summer days you can head to Serebryaniy, just north of the city, for some sand between your toes.
