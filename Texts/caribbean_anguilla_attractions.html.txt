 Attractions  The Valley, the island's only real town, is the geographic, commercial and political center of Anguilla. It's a small, rambling place that appears to consist of little more than a series of mini-malls. The lack of quaint colonial government buildings stems from the British decision to move its administration to St Kitts way back in 1825.  Far more visually stimulating are the exterior of Wallblake House, one of the oldest structures on the island, and the interior of the adjacent church, which has a unique design incorporating a decorative stone front, open-air sides and a ceiling shaped like the hull of a ship. The Anguilla National Trust Museum, which displays changing exhibits of Anguilla's history and natural environment, is also worth a visit.
