 Attractions  The volcanic origins of Wallis, the main island of the group, are evident in its many crater lakes. It is the busiest, most populated island, and reinforces this mantle by offering several video shops and even weekend discos! Your standard-issue small Pacific island, its low-key charms include lagoon islands, churches, crater lakes and archaeological dig sites. Mata Utu is the main village, and the rest of the island's attractions can be accessed via the island's circuit road.  Downtown Mata Utu, Wallis' main centre, is a mixture of the prosaic and the profound - the local cathedral mixes it up with restaurants, a hotel, a craft outlet, the King's Palace and the post office. A short walk westward you'll find the police station, airline office and the Uvea Shopping Centre. Other restaurants and hotels aren't too far away.  About 9km (6mi) south of Mata Utu lies Talietumu, a magnificent but little-known archaeological site. This beautifully restored site consists of fortified Tongan settlements established by the invading Tongans in around 1450. Tonga Toto is the other key archaeological site on Wallis. Its name has been translated to mean `the blood of Tongans', a reference to the ferocity of the Tongan invasions.   Lake Lalolalo is the most spectacular of the Wallis crater lakes. Forming almost a perfect circle, its rocky cliffs fall 30m down to the inky, 80m-deep water. Rumour has it that the American forces dumped equipment into the lake at the end of WWII. Wallis itself has few decent beaches so the surrounding lagoon's many (uninhabited) islands offer the best swimming and picnic spots. The pick of these are Faioa, Nukuhione and Nukuhifala.
