 Environment  Long ago the Sioux Indians called one of the region's major rivers minisota, meaning, sky-tinted waters. In the 'land of 10,000 lakes' (actually thousands more), the name is equally if not more apt today. Millions of annual vacationers seek out the waters for the wealth of outdoor recreation. In addition to all the water, forests, with all their recreational possibilities, cover 35% of the state.  Residents sometimes refer to their state as Minne snowta, and they have a point. Although it doesn't always, it can snow as early as October and as late as May. Residents in the central and northern regions shovel many feet per season. Drivers should be prepared and well-informed if blizzards have been forecast. If you're traveling in winter, build delays into your agenda.
