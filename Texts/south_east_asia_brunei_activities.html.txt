 Activities  Most activities in Brunei are of the organised, lycra-sports-gear, pay-to-play variety. The Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium is of Olympic proportions and includes a track and field complex for keen runners, a tennis centre, squash courts and a swimming pool. Golfers can enjoy an international standard course at Mentiri Golf Club, and there's also a driving range near the airport. Hear the pins rattle at the bowling alley on Jalan Tutong.
