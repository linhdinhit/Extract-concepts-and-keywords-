 Off the Beaten Track  This huge and well-funded museum has to be seen to be believed. Run by an organization that trains funeral directors in everything from embalming to merchandising, the museum documents the vast industry that profits from the American way of death. There are dozens of hearses, including the ill-fated 1916 bus that tipped on a San Francisco hill and dumped the dearly departed on the mourners. The museum is located 15 miles (24km) north of downtown on I-45.
