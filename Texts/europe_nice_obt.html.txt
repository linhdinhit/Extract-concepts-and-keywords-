 Off the Beaten Track  Commissioned by Nicolas II and his mother, and completed in 1912, this church was designed to resemble Saint-Basile in Moscow. With its six onion domes and the mix of grey marble, brightly coloured ceramic and red brick, the effect is definitely exotic. Inside, the frescoes, icons and panelling smack of Imperial Russia. The cathedral is in a park setting, north of the train station, and is open to visitors as long as they dress appropriately: no shorts, sleeveless shirts or mini skirts, please.
