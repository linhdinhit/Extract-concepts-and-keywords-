 Off the Beaten Track  75mi (120km) from Pago Pago, on Ta'u, in the national park, is Judds Crater. It's a six-hour walk from Ta'u village, and is a huge volcanic crater. Although impressive, getting there is most of the challenge. You'll need a local guide and lots of water. In the near future, the National Park rangers are planning a walking track to the crater. This will make the trip considerably easier, but much less of an adventure.
