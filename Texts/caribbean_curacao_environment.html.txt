 Environment  The 'ABC' islands - Aruba, Bonaire and Cura ao - are strung along the balmy southern reaches of the Caribbean Sea about 45 miles (70km) north of Venezuela. Cura ao is the politically dominant partner in the Netherlands Antilles (a federation comprising Bonaire, Saba, St Eustasius and the Dutch part of St Martin). It lies about 40 miles (65km) east of Aruba and about 30 miles (50km) west of Bonaire. The island is 37 miles (60km) from tip to toe and roughly 5 miles (8km) wide, just slightly smaller than Andorra. Its highest elevation is 1240ft (370m) Mt Christoffel.  Cura ao is scrubby, dusty, prickly and bumpy. The mahogany that was once plentiful on the island is now mostly doing duty as wardrobes and dining tables. Amongst the hardy plantlife that has taken its place is mata pisk (fish killer), a conical evergreen; sabalpalm, which is unique to Curaca o and neighboring Bonaire; and brasilwood, which is so soft that donkey saddles were once crafted from it. Cura ao's thorny family includes climbing snake cactus, candle cactus, melocactus (which resembles barbed testicles) and the pull-no-punches french prickle, which has salmon-colored flowers. The standout cactus on Cura ao is the kadushi, which can grow up to 30ft (10m) tall.  Animals on the island include the frisky white-tailed deer, a bug-eyed frog known as dori, a nonpoisonous arm-length whipsnake and more lizards than is strictly necessary. Flying creatures include chirpy bananaquits, stalky herons, squawky parakeets, tuneful troupials, tooting owls and rare white-tailed hawks.  Cura ao's climate hovers around 82 F (28 C) all year and constant trade winds keep humidity low. Rainfall peaks in November or December but the island is below the hurricane belt and a Cura aon deluge is unlikely to trouble much more than your cocktail umbrella.
