 Activities  Believe it or not: Maryland's state sport is jousting. The knights in shining armor are long gone, but the modern-day jousters need a fair amount of skill to catch rings of decreasing size with their lances. There's a jousting tournament every August in Cordova, near Easton, on Maryland's eastern shore.  Annapolis, 35mi (56km) south of Baltimore, is the sailing capital of the United States. If you know your way around a sailboat, you can probably find a place aboard someone's boat for the Wednesday evening or weekend races. There are limited sailing opportunities in Baltimore itself, mostly along the lines of a two- or three-hour bay cruise. If you must get on the Baltimore waters under your own steam, there are paddle boat rental outlets on the northern side of Inner Harbor, near the aquarium.   Cyclists can trundle around the country roads north of the city or take advantage of the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail Park, a 13mi (21km) trail that follows the old Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad route from Annapolis to Glen Burnie. Going to a baseball game is particularly enjoyable in Baltimore, though this is more for the enjoyment of the great retro Oriole Park at Camden Yards than for watching the erratic performance of the home team - the Orioles.
