 Attractions  The museum has good historical, architectural and military displays, including a well-preserved Muslim bathhouse and a detailed model of the Rock made in the 1860s. In the town centre around the museum, you can still see British fortifications, gates and gun emplacements. Most Spanish and Islamic buildings were destroyed in the 18th century sieges.
