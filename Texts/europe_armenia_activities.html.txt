 Activities  You can take an art tour with the Artist's Union, or if architecture and urban design are your thing, the Yerevan Institute for Architecture arranges tours. For cavers and outdoorsy types, the Armenian Speleological Society takes guided hikes, caving and mountain expeditions. They'll arrange excursions up to one month long, from easy walking to the toughest terrain over the most spectacular scenery in Armenia. Cycling is also an option, but it is largely unorganised and you'd be wise to bring spare parts with you. The country is overflowing with religious buildings, and you can spend months easily enough trying to see them all and not managing.
