 Activities  There are plenty of opportunities for hiking and bushwhacking through rainforest, as well as mountain climbing and rock climbing if you look hard enough around the Bongo and the Yade Massifs. You can cycle in the CAR, and it is a great way to make contact with locals. If you bring a football or soccer ball you'll make a splash with locals keen for a kick, and after soccer, basketball is Africa's most popular sport. Taking a wildlife safari is the best way to see the wildlife in some of the more remote parts of the country.
