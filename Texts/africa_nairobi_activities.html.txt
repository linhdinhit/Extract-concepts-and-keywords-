 Activities  Pretty well the main activity you'll be doing in Nairobi itself is running - from the touts trying to sell you a safari. Already got two safaris booked? Surely you should do a third (or cancel those two and do a better one)? That said, Nairobi is an excellent place to organise a safari (but choose carefully!) or a trek up Mt Kenya. Gaining popularity is white-water rafting on the Athi/Galana River. Otherwise, what the hell are you doing in Nairobi?
