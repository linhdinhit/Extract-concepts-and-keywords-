Its days as the beach playground of Eastern Europe are long past, and tourism hasn't really sunk its teeth back into the country. However, unless you like freezing cold, it might be an idea to avoid Yugoslavia in winter. Summer is festival season - Yugoslavia kicks up its heels in celebrations of jazz and classical music, theatre and poetry.     Events  There hasn't been much cause for celebration in Yugoslavia for the last few years, so the Yugoslavs are making up for it now with festivals aplenty. Belgrade hosts a film festival in February, an international theatre festival in mid-September, a summer jazz festival and a festival of classical music in November. Novi Sadians turn out for the Agricultural Fair in mid-May, as well as the Sterijino Pozorje Drama Festival and the Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj Children's Poetry Festival. Budva has a summer festival in (wait for it...) summer. Yugoslavia's main public holidays fall on New Year (1 and 2 January) and Orthodox Christmas (6 and 7 January).
