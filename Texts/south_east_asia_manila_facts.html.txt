 When to Go  With maximum temperatures hovering above 30 C (86 F), Manila isn't the place to go to cool off. There are two seasons: the dry season lasts from December to May; the rest of the year is sodden with heavy rain. From June to November you might find yourself in a typhoon. The best time to visit Manila and surrounds is February to April.     Events  Offices and banks are closed on public holidays, although shops and department stores stay open. All major Christian festivals are celebrated, as well as Independence Day (12 June), Bonifacio Day (National Heroes Day, 30 November) and Rizal Day (30 December). On Good Friday the entire country virtually closes down. Even public transport and the national airlines stop running. There are many crucifixion ceremonies throughout the country on this day, which have become popular attractions, especially those at San Fernando and Antipolo, near Manila.
