 Activities  As hometown to the giant outfitting companies Eddie Bauer and REI, it should come as no surprise that Seattle folk love their great outdoors. It's even possible to hike wilderness trails without ever leaving the city. Seward Park, which juts into Lake Washington 6 miles (10km) southeast of downtown, offers several miles of trails in a remnant of the area's old growth forest. Even longer trails are available in the 543 acre (220 hectare) Discovery Park, 5 miles (8km) northwest of downtown.  Another long-distance path that is welcoming to both hikers and bikers is the Burke-Gilman Trail, a 16.5-mile (26.5km) paved path that winds from Ballard to Log Boom Park on Seattle's Eastside. The trail follows an old rail line along the shores of Lake Union and Lake Washington, and the views are great. Nearby Green Lake Park is a favorite with swimmers and windsurfers in summer, and the paths that line Green Lake are often alive with joggers.  In good weather, the surface of Lake Union offers fine sailing, as well as sea and white-water kayaking. The Waterfront Activities Center on the University of Washington campus rents canoes and rowboats.  Seattle is fortunate to have several ski areas within easy drive of the city. Closest are the ski slopes at Snoqualmie Pass and Stevens Pass, 80 miles (125km) east of Seattle, and Crystal Mountain, 75 miles (121km) southeast of town near Mt Rainier. If you don't have a vehicle or don't want to face the drive, ski buses leave from several locations in the Seattle area.
