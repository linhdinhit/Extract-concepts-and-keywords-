It's even less busy in winter, but many attractions close in mid-October and don't reopen until Easter. Some mountain passes can be snowbound in winter.     Events  Wales wouldn't be Wales without eisteddfodau. The big one is the Royal National Eisteddfodd of Wales, a moveable show held in early August, but you could also try the International Eisteddfod, held in Llangollen every July, or the Urdd (Youth) Eisteddfod held in May. Wales' yearly festival of cows and ploughs, the Royal Welsh Agricultural Show, is on at Llanelwedd in mid-July.
