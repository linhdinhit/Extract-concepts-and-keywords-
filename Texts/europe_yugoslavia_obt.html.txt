 Off the Beaten Track  Near Montenegro's border with Bosnia, Durmitor's dramatic Tara Canyon - 100km long and 1067m deep - is reason enough to come here. Yugoslavian tourist brochures claim this is the second biggest canyon in the world after the Grand Canyon - whether it's true or not, it's certainly a top-notch cleft. The Tara River, a seething cascade of clean, green foam, races through the canyon and provides world-class thrills and spills for rafters.  Durmitor's 18 mountain lakes make this a lovely spot for hiking - you're never too far from a cool dip. Crno jezero, the largest of the lakes, lies at the base of Mount Meded, which makes a good day's climb. To the east of the park, Zabljak is one of Yugoslavia's best ski resorts.
