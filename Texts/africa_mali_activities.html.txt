 Activities  One of the best things you can do in Mali is take a hiking trek along the Bandiagara Escarpment. Depending on your time, budget, and level of fitness you can do anything from a one-day to an eight-day trek along the cliff face. Guides are not essential but will make the going easier as they can negotiate prices for staying overnight in the villages and point out the right tracks to follow. A river trip down the Niger is also a must. Again the extent of the trip is entirely flexible and can last as long as the river, or as short as the time it takes you to get hot and bothered over the less-than-luxurious conditions.   Taking a camel ride out to the Tuareg camps in Timbuktu might be a bit of a cliche and cause involuntary humming of the theme song from Lawrence of Arabia, but if you've arrived in Timbuktu by boat or plane it will give you a taste of desert life. You might add a bit of spice to the excursion by staying overnight in a Tuareg camp and experiencing the desert by moonlight. Staying overnight is officially illegal for security reasons but can be achieved with a bit of discretion.
