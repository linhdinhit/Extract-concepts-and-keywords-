 Off the Beaten Track  One of the most pristine and untouched areas of the Comoros is the small island of Chissioua Ouenefou, just off the south coast off Moheli, near Nioumachoua. It's part of a marine reserve. This former leper colony has a beautiful sandy beach at the southern end, which makes for good camping, and offers an excellent vantage point to go green sea turtle watching. Green sea turtles, almost extinct a couple of years ago, lumber about the island of Chissioua Ouenefou with all their old grace, but with a new protection order that prohibits their capture or endangerment. A couple of days of swimming, fishing, exploring the island on foot, turtle watching and camping out will see you right.  To get to Chissioua Ouenefou, you need to fly, or boat it, to Fomboni on Moheli. From Fomboni take a taxi-brousse to the village of Nioumachoua on the southern coast where you'll have to engage with a bit of palaver with a local boatman to negotiate a price for delivery to the island. From Moroni on Grand Comore to Chissioua Ouenefou is a distance of 90km (56mi).
