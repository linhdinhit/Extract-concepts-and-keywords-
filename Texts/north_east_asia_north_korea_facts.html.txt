 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: This is the difficult part. If you're from the US or South Korea you can pretty much forget about it. Other nationals may have some luck approaching the tourism office in the North Korean Embassy in Beijing; your chances of being granted a visa are far lower at other embassies. A visa, if it is going to be granted, can normally be granted quickly.Health risks: No particular risks, although there is a shortage of western medicines so it's not a great place to get sick. Traditional Korean medicine is available and is similar to the Chinese variety.Time:GMT/UTC plus nine hoursElectricity: 110/220V, 60 HzWeights & measures: Metric When to Go  The best months to visit North Korea are May, June, September and October. In May and June, the worst of winter will be gone and the days will be warming up, in September and October you'll get a brilliant display of autumn colours.     Events  North Korea does not celebrate Christmas or the Lunar New Year, nor many of South Korea's major holidays. May Day and Liberation Day are the big holidays, and the parades are huge extravaganzas featuring mass gymnastics, which rank among the country's most memorable sights. By all means try and be in P'yongyang for those events.
