 Activities  Watersports are popular along the UAE's coast, and the tourist industry is keen to promote the country as a winter 'sea & sun' destination for Europeans suffering seasonal chills. Most watersports facilities, like dive centres or jetski hire operations, are part of upmarket hotels and are not generally accessible to independent travellers. Camel safaris can be arranged in Al-Ain. Desert safaris or 'wadi bashing', which involves zooming around the desert in a 4WD, can be organised in Dubai or Sharjah. For a rather more timid but highly surreal experience, there are a number of golf courses with real grass in Dubai, though you'll have to be a guest at a swanky hotel or be invited by a member to play. There are also dress regulations to meet, high fees to pay and water conservation issues to wrestle with.
