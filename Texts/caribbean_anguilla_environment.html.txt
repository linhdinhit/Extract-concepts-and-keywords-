 Environment  Anguilla lies 200mi (320km) east of Puerto Rico, at the northeastern corner of the Caribbean. Its nearest neighbor is St Martin, just 5mi (8km) south. Just 16mi (25km) long and 3mi (5km) wide, Anguilla looks a little like a compass needle pointing northeast-southwest. The terrain is relatively flat; the highest of the island's rolling hills, Crocus Hill, reaches a mere 213ft (65m).  Anguilla's vegetation is a dryland type that's been degraded by overgrazing, particularly by free-ranging goats. The vegetation is sparse and predominantly scrub. Sea grape and coconut palms grow in beach areas, as do poisonous manchineel trees.  Although most are migratory, in all about 80 species of birds are found on Anguilla. Two colorful year-round residents are the black and yellow bananaquits and the green Antillean crested hummingbird. The island's numerous salt ponds attract egrets, herons, stilts, yellowlegs and white-cheeked pintail ducks. Anguilla's national bird is the turtle dove.  The average annual temperature is 81 F (27 C), with the hottest weather coming during hurricane season from June to October. The rainy season is from August to November.
