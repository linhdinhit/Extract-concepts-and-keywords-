 Off the Beaten Track  This national park, in the southern half of the island, encompasses 17,000 acres (6880 hectares) of Dominica's mountainous volcanic interior and contains many of the island's top wilderness sites. Most of the park is primordial rainforest, varying from jungles thick with tall, pillar-like gommier trees to the stunted cloud forest cover on the upper slopes of Morne Trois Pitons (4550 feet [1389m]) itself.  Emerald Pool, at the northernmost tip of the park, is a small basin in a lush green setting at the foot of a gentle waterfall. It's on the road that runs between Canefield and Castle Bruce, a drive which goes through jungle vegetation and has mountain views and lots of beep-as-you-go hairpin turns. The pool is a five-minute walk from the road, through a rainforest of ferns and tall trees.  Dominica's preeminent trek is the rugged day-long hike to Boiling Lake, the world's second-largest actively boiling lake. Geologists believe the 207-foot-wide (63m) lake is a flooded fumarole, a crack in the earth that is allowing hot gases to vent from the molten lava below. The eerie-looking lake sits inside a deep basin, its grayish waters veiled in steam, emitting bubbly burps.
