 Activities  Though potentially a great idea, hiking through Eritrea's eastern hills and mountain ranges, or in the tropical forest around Filfil, does have its drawbacks in the form of unexploded munitions left over from the Ethiopia conflict. Hikers should at the very least consult with local authorities on the safety of the area they plan to walk through and also consider hiring a guide to accompany them. If you like the sound of a trek but are too lazy to use your own legs, camel treks can be organised through several travel agents in Asmara.  Water enthusiasts will want to splash into the Red Sea to get their fill of the wet stuff. Diving and snorkelling are the activities of choice in the Dahlak Archipelago, which boasts some of the most pristine coral reefs in the Red Sea. The waters of the island group also harbour various man-made attractions - namely sunken Ethiopian dhows, Italian WWII warships and a rusty Russian tank or two - and play host to fishing tours. Underwater swimming can also be done off the southern city of Assab and you can water ski near Massawa.
