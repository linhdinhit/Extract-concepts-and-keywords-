 Off the Beaten Track  Cerro Verde national park has two incredible views: The first is the still steaming and impressive Volc n Izalco; and the second is of the blue volcanic crater lake Lago de Coatepeque on the eastern slope of the Volc n de Santa Ana, the highest volcano in El Salvador. Volc n Izalco 200 years ago was nothing but a hole in the earth from which columns of black sulfuric smoke would rise. Then a cone began to form and within a short time it grew to is present size of 1910m (6265ft). Izalco continued to erupt into this century, sending out smoke, boulders and flames that became such an impressive sight by night or day it earned the reputation as 'the lighthouse of the Pacific.' Though still classified as active, Izalco hasn't been heard from since 1966. A marked path leads to the top, about a 3-hour hike.  Cerro Verde is a 2-hour drive south of Santa Ana and is best reached by bus. If coming from San Salvador, Santa Ana is 63km (39mi) northwest, and a bus trip takes about 90 minutes.
