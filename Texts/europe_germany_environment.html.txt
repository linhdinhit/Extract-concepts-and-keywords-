 Environment  The lowlands in the north of Germany stretch from the Netherlands to Poland, skimming southern Denmark where it bridges the North and Baltic seas. The industrialised central belt cinches Belgium and Luxembourg to the Czech Republic's western prong. The Rhine and Main Rivers, long crucial for inland shipping, power through the troughs and gorges which cut through the Central Uplands. To the south, the Danube River drains the Bavarian highlands from the Black Forest, near the French and Swiss borders, to Munich. The southern reaches of the Bavarian Alps give way to Austria.  Germany is not prey to dramatic climatic extremes, although there are regional differences. The most reliably good weather is from May to October, with high summer a good bet for shorts and t-shirt, even in the north. Autumn is a good time to visit Germany. As the tourist scrum disperses and the forests turn golden, it's not too stifling to be active but still thirsty enough to end the day with a few well-deserved steins. Winter is wet, especially in the south, with snow rarely settling for long except in the high country.  A land as heavily populated and industrialised as Germany is not an obvious paradise for the naturalist. Over a third of the land is intensely cultivated and you'll never travel far without hitting a town. There isn't much in the way of wildlife (don't tell the bird-watchers) and most of the forests are like everything else in Germany: organised! That said, the Bavarian Forest in the south-east is the largest mountain forest in Europe and the Black Forest is big enough to be a bit wild. However, a concerted effort is being made to re-create original forest conditions in many locations. Forest fauna includes wild pig, fox and deer, but you're not likely to be caught in a stampede.
