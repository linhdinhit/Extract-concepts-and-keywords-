 Environment  Though slightly smaller than the US state of Oregon, Ghana is one of the most densely populated countries in West Africa. It lies south of Burkina Faso, between Togo to the east and the C te d'Ivoire to the west, on the Gulf of Guinea. Most of the country is made up of wooded hill ranges, wide valleys and low-lying coastal plains, though the northern third of the country is thick with rainforests. A fair chunk of central Ghana was swallowed by Lake Volta in 1964, when the Volta River was dammed and the lake swelled to become one of the largest in Africa.  The south-western area of Lake Volta is the site of the massive Kujani Game Reserve/Digya National Park, Ghana's largest protected area, which is known for its hippos, water buck, crocodiles and manatees. North-west of the lake is Ghana's best known national park, the Mole Game Reserve, where you can see lions, leopards and over 300 species of bird. Outside of these and a few other parks and reserves, you're unlikely to run into much of Ghana's wildlife, mostly because inroads to the outback are so limited. While you're here, though, keep your eyes peeled for signs of antelope, wild boar, forest elephant, the occasional big cat, a few species of monkey and interesting bird life.  While Ghana's average temperatures show little variety - floating between 25 C (75 F) and 29 C (84 F) - it's the thick humidity that you'll remember. There are three rainfall zones. Along the coast (including Accra), the rainfall is light and the rainy season lasts from April until June with a short spell in October. In the interior forests, the rains are heavier and last longer. In the north, the weather becomes drier, with only one rainy season, which lasts from May to September.
