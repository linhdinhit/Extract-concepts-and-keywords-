 Activities  There are several hiking trails in Ybycu and nature trails in the Parque National Cerro Cor . The fishing and camping are good at Villa Florida, while swimming and water sports are popular at Lago Ypacar , whose waters are thought to have heady curative powers. If you want to bust a gut, try climbing the 500m (1640ft) Cerro Le n or take an expedition into the Chaco wilderness (remember to bring plentiful supplies of food, water and fuel).
