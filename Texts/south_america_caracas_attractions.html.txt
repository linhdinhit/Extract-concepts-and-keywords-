 Attractions  Caracas was founded on the site of today's historic quarter, but any residual colonial flavor has long been swamped by modern high-rise buildings. It's a lively area, though, and boasts some important sites relating to Simon Bol var. The focus of the old town is leafy Plaza Bol var, with the inevitable monument to El Libertador at its heart. The plaza is a favorite playground for all manner of political visionaries and religious messiah-types, who deliver their impassioned speeches to an audience of nonplussed office workers each lunchtime.  The collection of notable buildings lining the square includes the city's cathedral, which replaced the original structure destroyed by the violent earthquake of 1641. The Bol var family chapel can easily be recognized by its modern sculpture of El Libertador. The square's southern side is dominated by the Concejo Municipal building, erected by Caracas' bishops in the 17th century to house a seminary and for a time taken over by the province's first university. The Museo Caracas on the ground floor highlights local history, and has some great models of the city as it appeared in the early 19th century and 1930s. To grasp just how much this city of almost five million has grown, take a look at the map dating from 1578 in the building's central courtyard.
