 Off the Beaten Track  There's not much to keep you in central Luxembourg, but the National Military Museum in Diekirch is almost worth the trip in itself. The museum's exhibits detail the events of the 1944-45 Battle of the Bulge and the liberation of Luxembourg from the Nazi scourge by US troops. It's open everyday from Easter through October.  If your taste for machismo is more slings and arrows than tanks and cannons, try the nearby Bourscheid Castle, a thousand-year-old relic sitting on a plateau overlooking farmland and the S re River. The castle is open to invaders from April to October, weekends only the rest of the year.  Diekirch is reached by car, bus or train in under 40 minutes from Luxembourg City. The castle is a short but windy drive northwest of Diekirch.
