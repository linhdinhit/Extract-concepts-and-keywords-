 Activities  Dublin is a beautiful, ancient and compact city, so it's no surprise that it features many great walking tours. Beautiful parks, history-rich suburbs and the best Georgian architecture in the world give travellers on foot some of the best city walks in the world. Dublin has its fair share of sporting pursuits as well. Hurling - a kind of aerial hockey that has to be seen to be believed - and Gaelic Football are Ireland's popular spectator sports. Fishing is enormously popular, and the coastal areas of Howth and Dun Laoghaire are great sea-fishing spots. Amazingly, the River Liffey has fair salmon fishing, and trout almost jumping onto your line near Clane, 20km (12mi) from the city centre. Golf, tennis, cycling, go-karting and bowling are also on offer. If you can take the less-than-warm temperatures, there are some beaches, such as the nearby Sutton, to dip your toe in, or you can do as Buck Mulligan did and swim in the Forty Foot Pool at Dun Laoghaire.  It's also not surprising that - given the weather - Dublin's best activities are enjoyed indoors. Whether your passion is fine art, literature, theatre or music, there are plenty of venues where you can enjoy yourself as a spectator or a practitioner. The activities and culture of Dublin regularly collide in informal spaces; for example, if Irish music is your scene you can usually find traditional pubs that - late in the night - turn into seis ns, or unscheduled jam sessions (all welcome). Many claim that enjoying a jar of the black stuff at such establishments is also a full-time activity, enjoyed by locals and out-of-towners alike.
