 Attractions  Dominating Donegall Square, and indeed the city, Belfast's imposing City Hall is a neo-Renaissance monolith of Portland stone pillars, pediments and parapets. The building's facade is rigidly symmetrical once more now that the huge 'Belfast Says No' banner has gone (negating the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement which for the first time gave the Dublin government a consultative role in Northern Ireland's affairs), and the interior is a sombre riot of Italian marble and oak panelling. The perimeter is dotted with statuary, notably a suitably dour-looking Queen Victoria, a monument to the victims of the Titanic and a statue of Sir Edward Harland, founder of the Harland & Wolff shipyard which constructed the doomed liner.  Donegall Square is lined with fancifully ornate edifices such as the Scottish Provident Building, littered with statues of industrial icons, sphinxes, dolphins and lions' heads. The Linen Hall Library nearby was established in 1788 'to improve the mind and excite a spirit of general inquiry'. Its famed Irish and local-studies collection includes a copy of everything written about Northern Ireland politics since 1966.
