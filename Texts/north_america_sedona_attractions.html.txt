 Attractions  Arizona's second most popular attraction, Oak Creek Canyon is located northeast of Sedona along Hwy 89A. This is where the canyon is at its narrowest, and the red, orange and white cliffs are the most dramatic. Forests of pine and juniper clothe the canyon, providing a scenic backdrop for trout fishing in the creek. Hikers are also attracted to the stunning West Fork, located in the Secret Mountain area.  The USDA Forest Service maintains six campgrounds in the canyon as well as picnic areas. It also maintains the Oak Creek Scenic Viewpoint, 16 miles (26km) north of Sedona at the top of a particularly steep and winding section of N Hwy 89A.
