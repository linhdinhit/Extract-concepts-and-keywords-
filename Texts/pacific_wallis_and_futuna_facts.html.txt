 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: European Union and Swiss nationals, and citizens of Canada, Australia and New Zealand are allowed entry for three months without a visa. Citizens of Japan and the US are allowed entry for one month without a visa.Health risks: Sunburn and coral cuts aside, there are few health risks. You can safely drink the water on Wallis, but on Futuna you should boil it thoroughly or drink bottled water. Although both islands have public hospitals, there's a limit to what they can treat - the enormous distance from specialised medical treatment is a health risk throughout most of the South Pacific. Don't forget to pack sunburn and antiseptic cream.Time: GMT/UTC + 12 hoursElectricity: 220V 50 HzWeights & measures: Metric When to Go  Anytime between May and October - the dry season - is ideal for a visit to Wallis & Futuna. The average temperature during this period, when the hot climate is tempered by sea breezes, is a comfortable 27 C (80 F). Temperatures tend to climb during the rainy season, November-April. Cyclones during this period are another reason to avoid visiting at this time.     Events  Apart from the standard Western public holidays such as Christmas, Easter and New Year, this French territory also celebrates Labor Day (1 May), Bastille Day (14 July), All Saints' Day (1 November) and Armistice Day (11 November). St Pierre Chanel Day (28 April) commemorates Futuna's first missionary who arrived in 1837 and was killed on the local king's orders just four years later. The three Wallis parishes also take holidays on 14 May, 29 June and 15 August.
