 Off the Beaten Track  This lovely town just 15km (9.3mi) from Stuttgart boasts a downtown scarcely changed from the Middle Ages, including half-timbered houses, a castle dating from the 16th century, and a 13th-century Lutheran church. Philosopher Friedrich Schelling was born here, and his ancestral home is one of the town's star attractions. The Steinhaus at the Upper Gate is the oldest building in Leonberg, dating from 1350. Situated at the gateway to the Black Forest, Leonberg is the perfect afternoon stop on the way to or from Stuttgart.
