 Off the Beaten Track  It's billed as the only authentic ghost town in the valley, suggesting there are some inauthentic ones waiting to be discovered. Goldfield Ghost Town dates back to a brief 1890s gold boom, when in typical style its construction was almost as rapid as its abandonment. Situated at the foothills of the Superstition Mountains, it's now become another of Scottsdale's family-oriented attractions, replete with tall tales and mysteries, including the mystery of the Lost Dutchman Mine. Cowboy wannabes will look forward to the gunfights, there's a narrow-gauge railroad for the trainspotters, and engineers will make a beeline for the museum collections of mining equipment. Everyone else will have to content themselves with soaking in the dusty atmosphere, marvelling at the mountain views and splurging in the shops and concessions.
