 Attractions  A one-stop shop for learning about Southwest Indian tribes' history, arts and culture, the Heard Museum is touted for quality rather than quantity. Sure, there are thousands of exhibits, but these are so well laid out (in so relatively small a space) that a visit is much more relaxing than the torturous schleps of most major museums. The Heard's kachina doll collection is outstanding, as are the audiovisual displays, live demonstrations and bookshop, which has the area's best - albeit priciest - selection of Native American arts and crafts. The Heard is on the northern outskirts of downtown, about 4 miles (7km) from the capitol.
