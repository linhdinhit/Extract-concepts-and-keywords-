 Attractions  Downtown Minneapolis is the Twin Cities' cultural heart and the place where visitors spend much of their time. Smack in the middle of downtown, Nicollet Mall is a 12-block shopping zone with all the usual trappings - trendy restaurants, boisterous bars, public sculptures and earnest street musicians. The pedestrian-only mall (city buses are allowed, but no private cars) was created in 1967 and extensively renovated in 1991. Despite some early controversies, Nicollet Mall has become a much-imitated model for urban renewal projects throughout North America.  An equally eye-catching landmark is the 51-story IDS Center just off Nicollet Mall at S 8th St. The octagonal glass skyscraper (the tallest in Minnesota) is considered one of architect Philip Johnson's finest works. More impressive still, it was featured in the opening credits of The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  Neither rain nor snow prevents sports-mad fans from worshipping at their domed downtown temple, the 62,000-seat Hubert H Humphrey Metrodome. It's home to the Vikings (professional US football), Twins (professional baseball) and Gophers (college football).  Less than a mile south is the sizable Minneapolis Institute of Arts, housed in a dramatic 1915 Beaux Arts building. The collection ranges from African masks to Chinese jade to European oil paintings (Van Gogh, Monet, Picasso, Magritte - you get the picture). From Dr Seuss to Mother Goose, art of a different kind is on offer in the institute's lobby, home to the nationally respected Children's Theatre Company.  It's a short hop east to the American Swedish Institute, a superb 33-room Romanesque mansion on Park Ave. Built in 1900 by Swedish-American publisher Swan Turnblad, it today houses a library and Swedish cultural center plus exhibits from the 1880s and '90s, when Minneapolis had a larger Swedish population than most cities in Sweden.
