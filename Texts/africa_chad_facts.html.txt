 Facts for the Traveler   Visas: Only German and French citizens can enter Chad without a visa. For all other nationals, visas for between one week and three months are fairly easy to obtain. From other African countries, visas are usually issued by the French embassy. You can't get a visa for Chad in Rwanda. Exit visas are required if travelling to Niger or Sudan.Health risks: You will require immunisations (and, often, proof of this) against yellow fever, cholera, tetanus, typhoid and hepatitis A. You'll also need to guard against giardia, dysentry, fungal infections, rabies, tuberculosis, bilharzia, diptheria, malaria, meningococcal meningitis, typhus and a whole textbook of other water-, insect- and air-borne diseases.Time: GMT/UTC + 1 hourElectricity:220 VWeights & measures:Metric When to Go  Because many of the roads in Chad aren't tarred, they become impossibly impassable in the wet season (June to September), so it's best to travel when it's dry. Between March and May, the average daily temperature of 45 C (110 F) also makes travel a little uncomfortable. From December to mid-February, the days are dry and warm and the nights quite cool, making this part of the year probably the best time to head to Chad.     Events  Not known for its party atmosphere, celebrations in Chad are confined to Muslim feasts, especially Tabaski or Id al Kabir, and private, tribe-specific ceremonies. On Sundays in N'Djamena many of the bars practice a modern ritual called the pari-match. Here, a young woman or women will book the entire bar, hoping to make money from alcohol sales. She will invite all her friends and acquaintences, but won't mind a bit if a stranger turns up in the mood for a few drinks. This practice doesn't occur in Muslim parts of town (naturally), and is frowned upon by the government.
