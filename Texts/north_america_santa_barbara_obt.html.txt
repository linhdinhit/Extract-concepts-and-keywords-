 Off the Beaten Track  For a pleasant day of sightseeing and drinking, take Hwy 154 out of town and head into the Santa Ynez Valley: the heart of Santa Barbara's wine country. Fortuitous fog and ocean breezes waft into the valley creating little pockets of weather well suited for growing grapes. About three dozen wineries, mostly family-run, produce Chardonnays as well as Pinot Noir, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties. Most are open for touring and tasting, and some have lovely picnic grounds. The visitor centers in Santa Barbara distribute free maps with brief descriptions of each winery, including tasting room hours. Worthwhile stops include Sunstone, just off Hwy 246, and Foley, south of Hwy 154.
