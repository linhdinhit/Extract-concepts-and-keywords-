 Attractions  The island of Mallorca is peppered with smaller beachside getaways, including the famous Deia and Alc dia with its Roman ruins, all of them quaint and lovely but a bit crowded during high season. If heading in the direction of Porto Cristo, get your fill of stalagtites and stalagmites at the stunningly-lit Caves of Drach. The caves contains one of the largest underground lakes in the world.  The rocky northwest coast and rugged Serra de Tramuntana mountain range make up 'the other Mallorca,' where you can lose yourself in the natural beauty of the island. One of the most typical Serra de Tramuntana village is Valldemossa, it's spectacular beauty and Gothic churches magnetic enough to attract luminaries such as Frederich Chopin and George Sand. Not far from Valldemosa is Deia, a village that has been occupied by artists, musicians and writers for nearly half a decade.
