 Off the Beaten Track  Scattered like forgotten stepping stones to Italy, this cluster of little-known and rarely visited islands lies a day trip away from Corfu's northern tip. Of the five islands, only Ereikousa, Mathraki and Othoni are inhabited, and even these are depopulated as most residents have high-tailed it to New York City. Ereikousa is the most popular of the three inhabited islands, and closest to Corfu. It's not quite the deserted island getaway of its promotional literature, although its beaches are great and you can count the accommodation and eating possibilities on one hand. Mathraki is wild, wooded and peaceful, with some great solitary walks and a lovely long beach. Othoni is the greatest distance from Corfu, and popular with Italian yachties - there's even an Italian restaurant on the island. Beach bums may find Othoni's pebbled beaches hardgoing, but the interior is wooded and the inland village of Horio has great views. Boats head out to the Diapondia Islands from Corfu Town three times a week in summer, and day excursions make the jaunt from Sidhari.
