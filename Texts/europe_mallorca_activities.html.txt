 Activities  The most popular activities on the island are probably partying, drinking and generally having a good time. However if you're after something a bit healthier, the hiking on Mallorca is great, particularly in the mountainous northwest; spring is the best time, as summer can be a bit hot and dry. The less hilly areas are better for cycling (unless you like peddling up mountains), and there are plenty of places on the island where you can hire bikes. If you like your activities wet (and not hangover-inducing), most beach resorts offer a choice of watersports, and hire out sailboards, catamarans, kayaks and pedalos. You can also take scuba-diving lessons and hire equipment on the island. For those who prefer slides to snorkels there's a selection of noisy water parks: don't forget your sun-tan lotion.
