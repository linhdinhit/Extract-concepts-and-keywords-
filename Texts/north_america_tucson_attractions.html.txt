 Attractions  Tucson grew up around a large presidio (walled fort) that was built by the Spanish in 1775 to house a garrison charged with protecting settlers from the Indians. This piece of military architecture, dubbed Old Pueblo by later Anglo arrivals, is no longer standing, but the easily walkable Presidio Historic District is nonetheless home to a number of other interesting historic buildings. The oldest structure in the area, raised up from the ground over 150 years ago, is thought to be La Casa Cordova. You can check out its aged interior via the adjacent Tucson Museum of Art, which has some worthwhile permanent exhibits of contemporary art, attention-getting multimedia displays and pre-Columbian artefacts exhumed from the archaeologically rich soils of Latin America. The museum displays more of its collection in nearby Fish House, built in 1868 by politician Edward Fish, and in the similar-vintage Stevens House- both were seminal establishments for the late-19th century Tucson social scene.  South of the presidio district is the distracting modernistic bulk of the Tucson Convention Centre. At the centre's northwestern end you'll find the Sosa-Carillo-Fremont House Museum, a restored 1880s period home run by the Arizona Historical Society. The house's triple-barrelled moniker is a tribute to its first three owners, namely the families Sosa and Carillo, followed by one-time Arizona governor John Fremont. Further south is the Barrio Historico District, the city's centre of commerce in the late 1800s and still a neighbourhood with business on its mind. Just off Cushing St is El Tiradito, a weird and fairly decrepit little shrine piously devoted to a man who was murdered here by his father-in-law after being caught having an affair with his mother-in-law. Paradoxically, people burn candles here in an effort to make their wishes come true.
