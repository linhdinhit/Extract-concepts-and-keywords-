 Facts for the Traveler   Visas:A visa is required for all visitors Comoros. You must have onward plane tickets. Thirty-day visas can be obtained upon arrival, but can only be paid for in French francs, and there are no money-changing facilities at the airport. Mayotte does not require visas from residents of the EU, the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Israel. Except for a handful of non-EU European countries, everyone else must have a visa.Health risks:There are no vaccinations required, but precautions against malaria should be taken.Time:GMT/UTC plus 3 hoursElectricity: 220V, 50HzWeights & measures: Metric When to Go  The wet season between November and April is not a particularly healthy time to visit Comoros. If you don't die from dehydration or sheer frustration at the oppressively humid conditions, you might find yourself caught in a monsoonal wind ( kashkazi), or cyclone. The best time to visit is in the cooler months between May and October. This also avoids Ramadan at the end of January/beginning of February, when the collective Comoran temper can suffer from the double whammy of continual fasting and oppressive heat.     Events  Most of the events on Comoros are connected to Islamic holy days. Ramadan, the traditional period of fasting for the Islamic world, differs from year to year. Id-ul-Fitr which marks the new moon, and signals the end of Ramadan, is also a time of celebration. Mayotte celebrates both Muslim holidays and the European holidays of Bastille Day, on 14 July, and Christmas Day.
