 Activities  If you're prepared to bring your own gear and travel long distances by unreliable transport methods, Tuvalu hosts many of the same activities popular on islands right across the Pacific, with the exception of bushwalking (not enough bush). Tuvalu is made almost entirely of coral, so diving and snorkeling will be rewarding experiences, though with coral reefs, there are always the dual dangers of cutting yourself if you get too close and being caught in strong ocean currents if you stray too far. Always ask locals about hazards particular to each area. Walking is also possible, however the size of the islands will often relegate a hike to mere stroll status.  Although there is one combined tennis/ basketball/ volleyball court, the most popular activity for visitors to Tuvalu is inactivity. With nothing in the way of organised tourist traps, this is about as far from Club Med as you will find in the Pacific. Walk around. Sit under a palm tree.
