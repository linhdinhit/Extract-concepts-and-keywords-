 Activities  Most activities on the main island involve clubs, societies and sports organisations. Swimming isn't much of an option at the beaches, as the water is so shallow that you can wade out as far as half a kilometre and still only be up to your knees. You're better off at clubs or hotel pools (especially if you're a woman). Otherwise, social life on the island consists mainly of eating and drinking out.
