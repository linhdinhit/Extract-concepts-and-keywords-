 Activities  Since Guam's greatest attractions are in the surrounding sea, scuba diving is high on the list of things to do. Underwater visibility is excellent and there are plenty of fishies and reefs. Surfing is also popular. Windsurfing and snorkelling paraphernalia is available for hire, as are canoes and kayaks. For the less sporty, the Atlantis submarine takes the paying public on tours of one of Guam's best reefs. On dry land, golf is the premier sporting pastime and there are seven courses on which to flaunt your plus fours. There's plenty of good swimming and hiking, especially at Tarzan Falls in central Guam, where such pursuits are known as boonie stomping - Guamanian American for venturing off the beaten track.
