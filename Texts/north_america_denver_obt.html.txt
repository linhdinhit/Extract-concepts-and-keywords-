 Off the Beaten Track  A short drive (but a far cry) from the capital, Boulder is the Plains region's sanctum of all that is tuned in, turned on and scented with patchouli. With more artists' co-ops and vegan eateries than you can shake a smudge stick at, this place is about as similar to cowpokey Colorado as it is to ... well, Denver. While the latter shines with its big-city lights, tiny Boulder sits quietly, contemplating its navel, reveling in its low-key ways. Know this, traveler: if Denver is the Queen City of the Plains, then plucky Boulder is the Knave.  Boulderites - one quarter of whom are university students - value their quality of life, a fact reflected in the human scale of the pedestrian Pearl St Mall, the town's network of bicycle routes and the surrounding greenbelt that allows the locals to enjoy the area's sylvan attractions within a Frisbee's fling of their homes.  Typically atypical, Boulder's centers of higher learning include the National Center for Atmospheric Research, where some of the world's fastest supercomputers (and supercomputer geeks) click and whir inside their striking sandstone home (designed by architect IM Pei) at the foot of the Flatiron Rock Formation. Closer to downtown, hipsters howl for the new-agey Naropa Institute, where poet Allen Ginsberg helped found the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics in homage to his fellow Beatnik bard. This definitely ain't your mother's Lit program.  Twenty-seven miles (43km) northwest of Denver, Boulder is an easy half-hour's drive from downtown Denver along Hwy 36. Buses between Denver and Boulder are frequent and can carry bicycles in their cargo compartments.
