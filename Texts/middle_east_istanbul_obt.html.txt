 Off the Beaten Track  Built in AD 532 and located diagonally across from Aya Sofya, this is the largest surviving Byzantine cistern in Istanbul. It's builder, Emperor Justinian, incapable of thinking in small terms, built it complete with columns, plinths and a Medusa head or two.  The cistern (sometimes referred to as the Sunken Palace) is 70m (230ft) wide and 140m (460ft) long, with 336 columns running down the major corridor. The head of Medusa is carved into two enormous blocks supporting the northwestern corner. Although the cistern has undergone a number of facelifts and a thorough spit, polish and clean between 1985 and 1988, water still drops atmospherically through the ceiling and carp frolic in the water. Coloured lights and Western classical music add a touch of ambience.
