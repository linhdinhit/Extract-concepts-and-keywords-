 Activities  There's a brace of tour operators in Georgetown specializing in overland camping treks to Kaieteur and Orinduik falls, horse riding and hiking in the Rupununi and rainforest, fishing and jungle treks at the Timberhead resort, as well as river trips and whitewater rafting on the Essequibo, Kamuni and Mazaruni rivers. There's also good swimming at Bartica, and birdwatching at Lethem.
