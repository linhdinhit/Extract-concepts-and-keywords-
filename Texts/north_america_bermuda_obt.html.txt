 Off the Beaten Track  This bird sanctuary, located south-east of Bermuda's airport, is being prepared for the reintroduction of the Bermuda petrel, or cahow, one of the most endangered birds in the world. Predators are being eliminated from the island in a bid to restore the island's precontact ecology. Not surprisingly, human access to the island is restricted, though the Bermuda Biological Station and the Bermuda Audubon Society occasionally bring groups to visit.
