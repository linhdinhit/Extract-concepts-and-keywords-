 Activities  Well, sure, nightclubbing, drinking and doing the horizontal hulu are all activities...in their own special way...but if you're thinking outdoors and legal, it's best to start off with water-based activities. Needless to say, with this much coastline anything that involves water - from sailing to using it to dilute diluting Scotch - is the way to go. Fishing is popular as is sailing and yachting with mooring fees at most of the yacht clubs being reasonabley priced. Facilities for other watersports, including water-skiing, windsurfing, parasailing and diving, are also available.  The Sport of Lawyers - golf - is available on dry land, as is tennis, but with the near-pefect weather and oodles of beautiful island scenery, hiking and cycling are never out of the picture.
