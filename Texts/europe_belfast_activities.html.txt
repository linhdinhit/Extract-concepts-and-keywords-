 Activities  Belfast is perfect for getting around on foot and there are several organised walking tours to choose from, taking in the city's history, pubs and sights. If you have Irish roots you might want to indulge in a little genealogical research at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland in Balmoral Ave or General Register Office in Chichester St. The scenic coastal route heading north from Belfast is a favourite for cycling, passing through the foothills of the Antrim Mountains to the Giant's Causeway. The Lagan Weir offers one-hour boat trips and the chance to do some fishing. Other outdoor exploits to keep your cheeks rosy include Gaelic football, hurling, soccer and rugby. For indoor fun the city's nightlife has never been better, with a booming club and live-music scene. Pubs run the gamut of trad to trendy, fun to funky, and some of them are so elaborate they should be classified as museums.
