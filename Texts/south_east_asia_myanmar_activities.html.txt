 Activities  Myanmar isn't exactly bursting with opportunities to get out and stretch your legs, and most lung-inflating activity is still restricted by the government. Out-of-town hiking is permitted in parts of Shan State, and you can hire guides in Kalaw and Nyaungshwe. You can make day-hikes to minority villages around Kalaw and Pindaya, do some jungle hiking on the island of Lampi Kyun or head uphill at Mt Kyaikto.  It's fine to bring your own bike into Myanmar and cycle anywhere in the unrestricted areas. The terrain is rough and unsuited to anything but the sturdiest mountain bike, and parts are very difficult to come by. You can hire Indian and Chinese bikes in Mandalay.   Diving tours are almost non-existent. About the only organised diving is around the Myeik Archipelago - liveaboard cruises are run out of Phuket and Kawthaung. Plenty of big-league diving sites have been identifitied, and business should be booming within the next couple of years.
