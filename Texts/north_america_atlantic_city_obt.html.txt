 Off the Beaten Track  Known as a middle-class resort town, Asbury Park was famous in the 1920s for it's all-too-cute 'Baby Parade', a collection costumed kids still seen in cheesier greeting cards today. The town shot to fame in the 1970s, when the young Bruce Springsteen, made a name for himself at the Stone Pony Club. The boss headlined a homecoming concert recently in the decrepit convention hall, but the town itself has past its glory days as a beach resort.  The town is about 60mi (97km) north of Atlantic City, best reached from the Garden State Parkway and accessible from Atlantic City by train and bus.
