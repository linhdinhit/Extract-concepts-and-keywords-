 Activities  Most of Taiwan is mountainous, and hiking here can be superb. Yushan and Hsuehshan provide a challenge for the keen mountaineer, while the less athletic should have a go at Alishan and Tungpu. The weather in Taiwan's mountains can be extremely changeable, so be prepared for cold, wet conditions, and in the rainy season watch out for landslides. Surfing spots are of variable quality, but the east coast, extreme north and extreme southern tips are definitely worth a try.  With so many mountains and so little snow, the inventive Taiwanese were bound to come up with grass skiing sooner or later. Several grass skiing resorts have sprung up around the island, and many also offer grass tobogganing and grass sledding. There are some good whitewater rafting runs on the Hsiukuluan River and the Laonung River.
