 Activities  In addition to all the walking to be done around the Rock, you can take advantage of sailing the waters around Gibraltar. The Bah a de Algeciras has a sizable population of dolphins, and from about April to September, several boats make two or more daily trips out to see them; at other times of year there's usually at least one in daily operation. Most go from Watergardens Quay or adjacent Marina Bay. You'll be unlucky if you don't get plenty of close-up dolphin contact.
