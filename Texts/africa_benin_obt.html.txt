 Off the Beaten Track  On the north-western border with Togo is the town of Bokoumbe. On the way from nearby Natitingou, you will pass the tallest mountain in Benin, and once there you will experience all the wonders of a west African trading village. The Bokoumbe market is regarded as perhaps the best such market in the country. It is as much a social event for people from the region as it is a trading point for market produce, and beer and fun are in abundance. You can buy rare, authentic carvings and smoking pipes as well as fabulous fresh produce. Every four years or so, the town is gripped by the Whipping Festival, where young men run around naked with whips beating up other young men from neighbouring villages. It is, of course, a rite of passage. Bokoumbe is 43km (27mi) south-west of Natitingou and about 600km (370mi) from Cotonou. The trip will take about nine hours.
