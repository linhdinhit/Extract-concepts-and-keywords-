 Activities  The Cariocoas are into cycling, and they two-wheel down paths around Lagoa das Freitas, Barra da Tijuca and on the oceanfront from Ipanema to Lema. Surfing is pretty popular with the locals as well - Arpoador, between Copacabana and Ipanema, is where most surfers congregate, though there are some fun breaks further out.  For high times, work up the nerve for some hang-gliding and para-gliding off the 510m (1673ft) Pedra Bonita - you can even arrange a voo duplo (double flight) with a pilot. Less windblown are helicopter flights over the city.  Excellent hiking and climbing are possible close to the city, as there are three national parks within Rio state; there are also good walking and jogging paths in the zona sul. If you're not breathless after all of this, you can check out the area's other numerous offerings - everything from tai chi to tennis is available. And you're sure to see some volleyball on the beach.
