 Off the Beaten Track  Moomomi Beach is ecologically unique: one of the few undisturbed coastal sand dune areas left in Hawaii. Among its grasses and shrubs are at least five endangered plant species that exist nowhere else in the world. There's also evidence it is one of the few populated islands where green sea turtles can still find a habitat suitable for breeding.  This beach may be something of a secret due to a small confusion created by its name: Moomomi Beach is not the small sandy beach at Moomomi Bay favoured by sunbathers. Instead take a 20-minute walk west of Moomomi Bay into Kawaaloa Bay: that's where you'll find the Moomomi Beach, which maybe should have been called Kawaaloa Beach. Or whatever. It's worth the extra trouble: three miles of lonely, wild shoreline encompassing a huge crescent bay. If you're driving, Moomomi Beach is accessible by dirt road only - not recommended for rental cars.
