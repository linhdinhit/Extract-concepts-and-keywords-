 Off the Beaten Track  This wild but beautiful island epitomises the ruggedness of the Brittany coast. An old local saying 'Qui voit Ouessant voit son sang' ('He who sees Ouessant sees his blood') dramatically expresses its untamed nature and the fear inspired by the area's powerful currents and treacherous rocks. The 8km (5mi)-long island guards the entrance to the Channel, and is appreciated as a visual landmark by over 50,000 ships every year.  While the inhabitants are no longer isolated from the rest of the world, centuries of tradition prevail: houses are painted blue and white for the Virgin Mary, or green and white to symbolise hope with interiors furnished from driftwood; gnarled old women make lace crosses to represent the souls of their husbands lost at sea; small black sheep roam freely over the land; and rago t de mouton (lamb baked under a layer of roots and herbs) remains a staple dish. Ouessant also has the world's most powerful lighthouse, good museums on local history and stunning walks and scenery.  The island is 20km from the mainland and can be reached from the ports of Brest or Le Conquet on Brittany's northwestern coast.
