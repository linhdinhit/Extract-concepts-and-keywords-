 Off the Beaten Track  At the southern end of the Kathmandu Valley, in a dark, somewhat spooky location, stands the temple of Dakshinkali. The temple is dedicated to the six-armed goddess Kali, Shiva's consort in her most sanguinary incarnation. Twice a week, Nepalese visitors journey here to satisfy her bloodlust. They bring buffaloes, chickens, ducks, goats, sheep and pigs, which are matter-of-factly despatched by having their throats slit or heads lopped off. These animals, some still writhing, are then dragged to a nearby stream where they are butchered for a feast at a later date. The blood runs freely every Saturday and especially during the October festival of Dasain when the image of Kali is literally bathed in the stuff.  Some 20km (12mi) from the city centre, Dakshinkali is just a crowded bus trip away (albeit only on the important days of sacrifice, Tuesdays and Saturdays). It's also an exhilarating mountain bike trip to the temple; 'exhilarating' in this context meaning lots of steep hills with terrific views as the ultimate pay-off.
