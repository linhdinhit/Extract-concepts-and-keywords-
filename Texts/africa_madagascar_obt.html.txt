 Off the Beaten Track  Mahajanga is Madagascar's second port, and sits at the mouth of the Betsiboka River on the Baie de Bombetoka, on the north-west coast. It's very hot and dusty, and very lethargic, and as it's difficult to get to travellers often ignore it. It is a crumbling frontier town with wide promenades, interesting architecture, shady arcades and flowering bougainvillea - one explanation for the town's name is that it comes from the Swahili meaning 'Town of Flowers'. There are numerous churches and at least 20 mosques, and the town has Madagascar's largest Comoran Muslim community. The beaches around town are relatively safe, if stained blood red from the highland topsoil being washed out to sea.  Facing the Canal de Mozambique, Mahajanga is 400km (248mi) north-west of Tana. You can fly there from Tana, Nosy Be, and Antsiranana, and it is also a transit point for flights to remote west coast settlements. You can also make the trip by taxi-brousse from Tana, a 12-15 hour (much longer in the wet season) journey that is a vision of environmental catastrophe.
