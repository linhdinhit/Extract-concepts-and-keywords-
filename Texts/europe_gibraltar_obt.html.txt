 Off the Beaten Track  The Great Siege Tunnels were gun emplacements hewn out by hand by the British during the 1779-83 siege. They constitute a tiny proportion of the more than 70km (43.4mi) of tunnels in the Rock, most of which are off limits to the public. Nearby is the Tower of Homage, the last vestige of Gibraltar's Muslim castle built in 1333. To get to the tunnels, walk to Princess Caroline's battery, about 30 minutes north (downhill) from the top cable-car station on the Rock. You'll come to a Military Heritage Centre. From here, a road leads up to the impressive tunnels.
