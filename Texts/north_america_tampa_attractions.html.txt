 Attractions  Mosey along to MOSI to see one of the most educational, absorbing and child-friendly science fairs in Florida. Set up in an impressively overfed building on Fowler Ave, to the north of Tampa's downtown, the museum is wedged between the academic campus of the University of South Florida and the no-brainer rides of Busch Gardens, and contains a terrific array of hands-on exhibits. You can play an oversized game of pinball to see how energy is produced, take out the average American's distinctly greater-than-average amount of domestic trash, and pilot a small hot air balloon (though unlike other ballooning trips, this one comes without a sunrise or a glass of champagne). The museum also has various changing exhibits and an IMAX cinema where you can get up close and personal with the images on the screen.  Museum fanciers should also make the short trip west from downtown across the Hillsborough River to the University of Tampa campus. At the southern end is the whimsical Henry B Plant Museum. It may sound like a botanical garden but it's actually a restored welcome-if-you're-filthy-rich hotel that was built in 1891 by Florida railroad magnate Henry B Plant. In its day it was about as luxurious an accommodation option as you could get, with extravagantly outfitted en-suite rooms, a solarium, a grand salon, and an expensively eclectic collection of furniture garnered during Plant's world travels. The hotel overestimated the extent of its Tampa region patronage, however, and shut down at the start of last century, only to be taken over by the city and subsequently be reopened as an historical exhibit un 1974.
