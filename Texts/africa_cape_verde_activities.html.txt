 Activities  Cape Verde's many hilly islands offer good hiking. One of the best places for a short trek is the hilly green interior of Santo Ant o Island. The main hike is up Ribeira Grande Mountain, some 10km (6mi) south of the town of Ribeira Grande, which is on the north-eastern coast. Getting to the top and back takes most of a day. Brava and S o Vicente also have some excellent hikes.
