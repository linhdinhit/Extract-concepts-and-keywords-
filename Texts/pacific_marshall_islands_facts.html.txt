Diving is at its best from May through October, when the water is calmest, though water temperatures are bathlike all year round.     Events  Majuro plays host to a number of fishing tournaments each year, with the largest held on the weekend before the fourth Thursday in November and on the weekend closest to 4 July. Many islanders, expats and a growing number of international sportfishing enthusiasts show up with baited hooks.
