 Activities  Hanoi is a city that loves its out-of-doors, and there are plenty of ways to burn off that com tay cam. Several tennis courts, including those in the Van Phuc Diplomatic Quarter, are ready for your love. Hanoi also boasts a few public pools for swimming, and larger hotels will often let you take a dip for a fee.  Though Ho Chi Minh's advisers declared golf a 'bourgeois practice' back in 1975, turning courses into farming cooperatives, times are changing. Since 1992, even Communist Party members have been spoiling their walks at private greens, some of which are open to visitors.  The city also boasts a chapter of the Hash House Harriers, a loosely organized international club that was founded in Malasia during the 1930s. Activities can include a morning jog or and evening beer bash. Look for announcements in The Guide, Time Out or in expat bars.  If you'd rather get your exercise indoors, there are fitness centers throughout Hanoi where you can work out for a fee. Venues offering table tennis, billiards and martial arts are also well represented.
