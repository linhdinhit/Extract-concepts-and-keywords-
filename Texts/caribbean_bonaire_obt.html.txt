 Off the Beaten Track  This uninhabited islet is a short boat ride from Kralendijk. Surrounded by reefs, it's a popular picnic spot and jumping off point for dives. Unlike much of Big Bonaire, the little one has white sandy beaches. Due to its popularity with seabirds and nesting turtles, Klein Bonaire is one of two local areas covered by the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance.
