 Off the Beaten Track  The 1676m (5500ft) mountain 16km (10mi) north west of Chiang Mai is named after a hermit who lived on the mountain's slops for many years. Near the summit is perhaps the north's most sacred temples, the 600 year old Wat Phra Doi Suthep. After climbing a winding path, then tackling 300 steps, visitors are greeted with a great aerial view of Chiang Mai (weather permitting), and - inside the temple - an exquisite, copper-plated chedi topped by a five-tiered gold umbrella.  The area around the w t features several other attractions of interest to visitors. Phra Tamnak Phu Phing is a winter palace for the royal family and has beautiful gardens open to the public. A fairly touristy Hmong hill-tribe village is worth visiting - especially if you won't have the chance to make it out to a more remote village - and the locals sell Hmong handicrafts. There is also the popular Monthathon Falls, which is a well-frequented swimming spot for Chiang Mai residents on weekends.
