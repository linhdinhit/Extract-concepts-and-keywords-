 Attractions  Narrow, winding streets and the smell of coffee in the air probably mean you're in the North End, Boston's oldest neighborhood and home to much of the city's Italian population. The heart of the Italian section is Salem Street, crammed with bakeries, cafes, delicatessens and candy shops. Among the remnants of Boston's early days are Copp's Hill Burying Ground, serving stiffs since 1660 (look for headstones pockmarked by Revolutionary War musket balls); the tiny clapboard Paul Revere House, built in 1680 and the oldest house in Boston; and the 1723 Old North Church, where two lanterns were hung in the steeple to signal the Brits' arrival by sea, which was followed swiftly by the first battle of the Revolutionary War.
