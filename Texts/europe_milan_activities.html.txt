 Activities  There are plenty of ways to keep fit in Milan. As befits a city so obsessed with working hard, there are numerous gyms where you can arrange a short-term membership and work out to your heart's content. Bicycling is another popular pastime; just be careful, as the Milanese tend to drive the same way they live, at full throttle.  If you get out of the city, there are opportunities for action no matter what the season. When it's warm, escape to one of the many Alpine lakes for boating, water skiing or swimming. As soon as the snow starts to fall, head to the mountains for plenty of world-class skiing and snowboarding.
