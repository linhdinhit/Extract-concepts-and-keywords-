 Activities  Sort out your spokes: Guinea-Bissau is great bicycling country. Bikes are easy to come by if you ask around, and on much of the mainland and the islands, this is the best way to get about. Swimming is another popular activity off the islands' beaches, and some hotels offer deep-sea fishing and other water sports.  With its abundance of natural parks and unspoilt wilderness wildlife-watching is a common pastime, so pack your binoculars. Some areas are also good for hiking.
