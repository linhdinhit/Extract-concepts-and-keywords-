 Off the Beaten Track  Sassandra is best known for its wonderful beaches. But what makes it special is that it's also an ethnic Fanti fishing village, with an active port and a scenic river to explore. If you're up to trying some highly recommended bangui (palm wine), there's plenty of it here. The town was once an important trading post, but when the port at nearby San Pedro was built, it went into decline.  The beaches are all west of Sassandra, along a dirt road. The first one, big-waved Plage Le Bivouac, is walking distance from the village; for the remainder, you'll have to hitch a ride or take a taxi. The prized jewel is peaceful Poly-Plage and its tiny Fanti fishing village. Sassandra is 210km (130mi) west of Abidjan. Buses ply daily between the two.
