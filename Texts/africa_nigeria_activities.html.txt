 Activities  Nigeria is not known for its teeming wildlife but Yankari National Park is the place to see what there is. It's an bird watching's dream with over 600 species roosting around its interior. The Gashaka Game Reserve, near Yola, is the largest national park in Nigeria and is home to chimp, hippos and a staggering number of birds. Gembu, near the Cameroon border, is good for hiking as is Bukura, especially around the Kurra Falls. Another popular hiking destination is the Assop Waterfalls but if you visit the falls be prepared for a day hike or longer (camping may be possible). There are a number of popular swimming beaches around Lagos, although the water is never clear and some beaches have a strong undertow.
