 Environment  A century ago Hanoi was surrounded by dense woodland; though economic and population growth have taken their toll, it's still home to more than 200,000 trees. This is an urban area, complete with legions of smoke-spewing motorbikes, factories introducing all manner of toxins into the environment and plenty of denuded hillsides shedding precious topsoil into choked streams. In short, it echoes the environment of most major cities on Earth.  If you're looking for mother nature's Vietnam (or simply a breather from all the hustle and bustle), you are within a half day's drive of several national parks. Cat Ba National Park is an island boasting unparalleled ecological diversity, a few quaint fishing villages and lots of waterfalls. Cuc Phuong is less popular among the backpacking set, but it's an easy drive from town and offers plenty of great hiking opportunities. The park is also home to the Endangered Primate Rescue Center, dedicated to saving the country's fast declining monkey and ape populations from extinction.
