 Off the Beaten Track  The innumerable mouths of the ganges form the world's largest delta, and part of this vast mangrove swamp makes up the Sunderbans Wildlife Sanctuary, which stretches well into Bangladesh, covering 2585 sq km (1008 sq mi). Mangrove swamps may not sound overly exciting but the sanctuary is a World Heritage site and has one of the largest tiger populations of any park worldwide (estimated to number just under 300 in 2000). The notoriously shy tigers may not give you much of a look-in but sighting the big cats in their natural habitat is an exhilarating experience. The sanctuary is otherwise blissfully peaceful after the mayhem of Kolkata, with plenty for the senses to absorb, from birdlife to monkeys and even a wild pig or two.  Although barely 100km (62mi) from Kolkata, the journey to Sajnekhali can seem a world away, with India's version of planes, trains and automobiles - known as bus, boat and cycle-rickshaw - involved in getting you to the Sajnekhali visitors' centre (a six-hour journey - if you're lucky). It is easiest to organise a tour from Kolkata through the West Bengal Tourist Centre (WBTC) which includes the return journey (one or two nights), permits, food and accommodation. A small entry fee is charged at Sajnekhali visitors centre, where boats through the mangroves depart.
