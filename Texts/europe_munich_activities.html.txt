 Activities  There's stacks of outdoor fun to be had in Munich. First off, there's boating in the English Garden, rafting on the Isar River, nude bathing on the riverbanks, surfing like you've never seen in the English Garden and heaps of swimming opportunities, complete with diving towers and saunas (swimming in the river isn't advisable, but heaps of people do it in summer). Cycling is made easier by the provision of bike routes, and if you'd rather move with the pack there are several pedal tours, complete with running commentary and beer-garden finale. Ice skating can be had year-round in the Olympiapark, and in winter at Nymphenburg and in the English Garden. In-line skating can be done at Kunstpark Ost and Olympiapark. Tennis has been popular here ever since Boris Becker hit the court in the 1980s. Indoor sorts can try their hand at one of the city's billiard halls.
