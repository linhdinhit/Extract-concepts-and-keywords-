 Activities   Diving is Niue's BIG drawcard - the visibility is stunning, and the water is warm (peaking at 29 C/85 F in January, and falling to only 25 C/75 F in August). The snorkelling is mindboggling in Snake Gully, and a little less crowded with sea creatures at the Limu Pools, the Matapa Chasm and, on the east coast, Vaitafe. Swimming is difficult because of all those cliffs and caves, but there are a few tiny patches of beach if you look hard enough, and some fantastic natural rock pools. It's not a good idea to swim outside the reef. Fishing is limited, and it's illegal using scuba equipment - the best bet is to go out with a charter company. A couple of companies operate walking tours, as well as village visits, traditional canoe trips, reef walks, cave tours and forest walks (but be warned - the knife-edge rocks will test even the sturdiest of soles). It's possible to mountain bike around the island's 60km (37mi) perimeter road, but the heat, humidity and often bumpy conditions make it thirsty work. Whale watching is a possibility June-November, as that's when humpback whales come to Niue's waters to breed, and pods of spinner dolphins can often be seen spinning around in the water offshore from Alofi. Hit the island's bars on a Friday or Saturday night, and you'll find a lot of dancing going on - which could explain why Sunday is such a rigorously observed day of rest.
