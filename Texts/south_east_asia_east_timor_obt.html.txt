 Off the Beaten Track  The old hill towns of Maubisse and Ermera make a good break as a day trip from Dili and the heat of the coast. Ermera is renowned for its coffee plantations, many of which have survived, and Maubisse's impressive former government rest-house has reopened as a hotel, completely restored to its Portuguese-era condition. The mountain scenery here is spectacular but, as with most of the country, the towns were badly damaged in the events of 1999.
