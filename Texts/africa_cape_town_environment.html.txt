 Environment  The ecology and environment around the Cape changed drastically within a few decades of the European invasion. Dense forests that were once home to lion, elephant, hippo, black rhino, buffalo, hyena and leopard vanished, and today none of these wild beasties lurk anywhere near Cape Town.  To replace the forests, early governors encouraged settlers to plant oaks. They found, however, that the kind climate allowed the trees to grow too quickly to produce tough wood. Today, the characteristic tree on Table Mountain is the endemic silver-leafed witteboom. The peninsula's dense foliage (called fynbos or fine bush) is also highly localized.
