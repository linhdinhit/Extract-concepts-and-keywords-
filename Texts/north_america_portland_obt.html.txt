 Off the Beaten Track  The International Rose Test Gardens is one of the main reasons behind Portland's 'Rose City' moniker. Among the nation's oldest rose gardens, the park sprawls across acres of manicured lawns, fountains and flower beds. More than just a beautiful public park, the rose gardens are also the testing grounds for the American Rose Society and All-American Rose selections. Over 400 rose varieties are contained in the permanent gardens, including many old and rare varieties. From June to September, the scent and colors are seductively overpowering.
