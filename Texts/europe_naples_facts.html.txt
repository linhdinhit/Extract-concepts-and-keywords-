 When to Go  The best time to visit is from April to June, when prices are lower and there's elbow room in Naples'lively streets and piazzas. Late July and August is the time to avoid Italy altogether - the weather boils, prices are inflated and the whole country swarms with holidaymakers. Most Italians go on holiday in August, abandoning the cities and leaving many shops, hotels and restaurants closed.     Events  Naples' main festivals honour San Gennaro. On the first Sunday in May, on 19 September and on 16 December each year, thousands gather in the cathedral for the Festa di San Gennaro to pray that the saint's blood, held in two phials, will liquefy: a miracle said to save the city from potential disasters.  Other important festivals are the Madonna del Carmine held on 16 July in Piazza del Carmine, which culminates in a fireworks display and the Madonna di Piedigrotta (5 to 12 September). At Christmas, thousands of elaborate nativity scenes are erected around the city.   Neapolis Rock Festival, held at the height of summer, attracts top international acts. It's held west of town, down by the beach at Arenile di Bagnoli.
