 Attractions  The minster dominates York's landscape and psyche, and is proudly marketed as the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe. The building's foundations reveal the site's ancient history, including evidence of the original assembly hall that lay at the heart of the Romans' military headquarters; the wooden chapel built for bishop Paulinus' baptism of King Edwin in 627; a subsequent stone church; the church destroyed by William the Conqueror during his 'harrying of the North'; and a Norman church dating from around 1060. The structure's historical significance is more than matched by its world-beating collection of stained glass, most notably the fabled Great East Window (1408), the largest medieval stained-glass window on the planet.  Today's multistyled structure incorporates the Early English northern transept (1241-60); the Decorated-style nave, choir and octagonal chapter house (1260-1405); and, at the cathedral's heart, the perpendicular-style lantern tower (1460-80). More-recent amendments were made following the disastrous fire of 1984, which severely damaged the south transept; the minster was also damaged by fire in 1829 and 1840. York Minster is imbued with the specially charged atmosphere shared by large historic buildings, and there's a wealth of tiny details to search for, from tiny cherubs to feudal shields and dragon's heads. The 275-step climb to the top of the lantern tower is rewarded with a bird's-eye view of York. The best views of the minster itself can be gained by ambling along the stretch of city wall from Bootham Bar to Monk Bar (the latter retaining its portcullis).
