 Activities  With its spectacular bird life, Ethiopia has plenty to keep even the most discerning twitcher busy - the Rift Valley lakes are among the best spots for bird watching. There aren't many places to get away from it all in this populous country, but Entoto National Park, near Addis Ababa, has some lovely walks. There's also trekking and mule-treks in Bale Mountains National Park and Simien Mountains National Park. If you're visiting Bahar Dar, on Lake Tana, hire a bike in town and take a ride around the water's edge. Lake Langano is the only bilharzia-free lake in the country, so if you want to swim, this is the place to do it.
