 Attractions  History buffs and dipsomaniacs wishing to raise a glass to town founder 'Gassy' Jack Deighton should head to the heart of Gastown, where the famed publican's statue stands. Along Water St at the crook of the elbow of the peninsula, the once-shabby Gastown underwent a bit of renovating in the 1970s to become a bright and shiny neo-Victorian business district. Nineteenth-century office buildings now house restaurants, bars, boutiques and galleries; old lamps line the brick streets and vendors and buskers add to the holiday feel of the area. At the western end of Water St is the world's first steam clock; you can see its works through glass panels and hear it toot every 15 minutes.
