 Off the Beaten Track  Jericoacoara is the latest remote-and-primitive 'in' beach to become popular among backpackers, wind-surfers and hipper Brazilians. Situated on the Cear coast, northwest of Fortaleza, Jericoacoara is a small fishing village, where dozens of palms drowning in sand dunes face jangadas (sailboats) stuck on a broad grey beach. Goats, sheep, cattle, horses and dogs roam the sandy streets at will.  You can boogie at the forr held every Wednesday and Saturday: just follow the music. You can also climb the sand dunes (perhaps to watch the sunset), hitch a ride on a jangada, or walk to Pedra Furada, a rock 3km (2mi) east along the beach. You can also hire horses and gallop along the beach.
