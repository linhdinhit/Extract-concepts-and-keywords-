 Activities  Edinburgh boasts a wide variety of recreational activities. Favorite outdoor venues include Holyrood Park, Meadow Park and Bruntsfield Links. There are plenty of good walks, such as following the Water of Leith for a relaxed stroll through the city or climbing up to Arthur's Seat. Cycling is made easier around the city and out into the surrounding countryside with Edinburgh's network of signposted cycle paths. Golf is a favorite pastime and there are lots of courses around Edinburgh. The Bawsinch Nature Reserve is a great spot for bird watching, as are other places a little further afield. You can horse ride around Edinburgh, and the Firth of Forth provides sheltered waters for all kinds of sailing. Europe's longest dry slope can be found in the Pentland Hills, taking care of all skiing needs, sort of. Swimming is a bit chilly in the Firth of Forth, but indoor alternatives do the trick nicely.
