 Activities  Syria's main drawcard for leg-stretching types is hiking. There are no organised facilities for hikers, but there's plenty of appealing terrain. Possibilities include walking between Syria's Crusader castles or hiking the mountainous strip of land between Lebanon and Turkey. Unfortunately, there are no maps available, so you're obliged to follow roads.  If you've never had a Turkish bath, Syria is a good place to start. There are several good public baths in Aleppo and Damascus, and the full wash, steam bath and massage package does wonders for the body. Bathing is usually done in segregated sex groups.
