 Activities  There's no excuse to be idle in the first city to be awarded British City of Sport status. For speed junkies, there's stock car racing in Brandon, horse racing at a variety of racecourses and greyhound racing at Perry Barr.  If you're going to ride in a steam train, you may as well do it in the city where they were invented (at least if it breaks down there are people who know how to fix it). The Shakespeare Express choo choos every Sunday in summer from Tyseley Locomotive Works on the Warwick Rd (A41) in Birmingham to Stratford-upon-Avon.  Winter-sports fans can practise their skiing and snowboarding at Tamworth Snowdome, an indoor real snow slope; Birmingham also has a rink for ice-skating. As well as the usual rugby and football clubs, Birmingham is known for its cricket at the famous Warwickshire County Cricket Ground in Edgbaston, and a variety of golf courses, including the Belfry.  It may look like a mass of modern buildings, but Birmingham has over 200 parks where visitors can go walking or jogging. Cannon Hill Park also has tennis courts, bowling greens, nature trails and boating lakes, and if you like water but don't want to row you can take canal trips from Gas St Basin in the centre of town. There are also plenty of walks you can take along the canals.
