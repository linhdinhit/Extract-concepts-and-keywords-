 Activities  Visiting Acapulco's beaches tops most visitors' lists of things to do here. Just about everything that can be done on, under or above the water is done in Acapulco. On the bay, water-skiing, wind surfing and parasailing are all popular activities. The smaller beaches have boats of all kinds: sailboats, fishing boats, motorboats, pedal boats and canoes. They also usually hire out snorkeling gear, inner tubes and water bicycles. Cruises are available day and night; they range from multilevel boats with blaring salsa music and open bars to yachts offering quiet sunset cruises around the bay. Boats will take you scuba diving, deep-sea fishing or whale watching. We could go on...  Away from the water, there is bowling, roller skating, horse riding, ultralight aircraft rides and bungee jumping. As well, there are golf courses and scores of tennis courts. Mountain bike tours and jungle tours can also be arranged. For a fast, white-knuckle boat ride on the R o Papagayo, try the New Zealand import, the Shotover Jet. And if it's the kind of thing that takes your fancy, you can watch a bullfight, held weekly at the Plaza de Toros. Of course if the nightlife has kept you up to the wee hours, you can always sleep all day.
