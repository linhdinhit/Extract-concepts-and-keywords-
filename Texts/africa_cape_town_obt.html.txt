 Off the Beaten Track  Proclaimed a UN World Heritage Site in 1999, Robben Island is unmissable. Most likely you will have to endure crowds and being hustled around on a guided tour - such is the price of the island's infamy. Still you must go to see this shrine to Struggle. Used as a prison from the early days of the VOC right up until the first years of majority rule, Robben Island's most famous involuntary resident was Nelson Mandela. You will learn much of what happened to other inmates as well, since one will be leading your tour. The guides are happy to answer questions and, although some understandably remain bitter, as a whole this is the best demonstration of reconciliation you could hope to see in Cape Town.
