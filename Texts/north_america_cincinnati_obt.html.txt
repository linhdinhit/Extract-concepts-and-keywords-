 Off the Beaten Track  Although Cincinnati is relatively well preserved, Covington, across the Ohio River in neighboring Kentucky, offers a rare glimpse of the 19th-century Midwest. Just a few minutes' walk south over the John A Roebling Suspension Bridge (the dry run for New York's Brooklyn Bridge) brings you to a neighborhood of 100-year-old rowhouses, antique shops and German restaurants. Though by day it's little more than a floating mall, Covington Landing, at the foot of the bridge, is a jumping nightspot after sundown.
