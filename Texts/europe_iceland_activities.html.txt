 Activities  There are unlimited trekking opportunities in Iceland, and walks can range from an afternoon hike to a two-week wilderness trek. Some of the country's best hiking can be found in the remote areas of Landmannalaugar, L trabjarg and Hornstrandir, or in Reykjanesf lkvangur, right in Reykjav k's backyard. There are good skiing facilities at Reykjav k, Akureyri, Bl fjöll (just southeast of Reykjav k) and Hl arfjall (near Akureyri). You can also try sledding on the Langjökull Icecap, whitewater rafting on the Hv t (White River), spelunking in the Hallmundarhraun Caves near H safell, horseback riding in the interior and swimming in geothermal pools. For something a little different, you can have a hit-out at the Arctic Open, held in Akureyri, which is an all-night 'midnight sun' golf tournament attracting amateurs and professionals from around the world.
