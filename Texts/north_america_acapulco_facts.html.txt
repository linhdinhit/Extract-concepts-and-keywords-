 When to Go  If you're wanting to avoid the tourist crowds, you've got the wrong city - the tropical climate of Acapulco means the weather is close to perfect all year round. Tourism is seasonal, however, with high season from the middle of December until the end of Easter, and another flurry of activity during the July and August school holidays. Probably the busiest time of the year in Acapulco is Semana Santa, the week leading up to Easter, when the city fills with visitors and there's lots of action in the discos, on the beaches and all over town. If you're traveling at this time or Christmas-New Year, you'd be wise to book transport and accommodations in advance.     Events  Acapulco never needs an excuse for a party, but like all of Mexico it loves its fiestas. The Festivales de Acapulco, held for one week in May, features Mexican and international music at many venues around town. International film festivals include the Festival de Cine Negro (Black Film Festival) held the second week of June, and the Festival de Cine Frances (French Film Festival) held for a week in late November. As Mexico is the location of many mysterious UFO sightings, the Congreso Mundial OVNI (World UFO Congress) is held regularly in Acapulco, usually in December. The Festival de la Virgen de Guadalupe, for Mexico's patron saint, is celebrated all night on December 11 and all the following day, with street processions accompanied by small marching bands, fireworks and folk dances, all converging on the cathedral in the Z calo (town square), where costumed children congregate. There are also smaller religious celebrations, regattas and fishing tournaments held throughout the year.
