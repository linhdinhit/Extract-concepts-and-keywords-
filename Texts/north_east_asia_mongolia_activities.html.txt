 Activities  The Four Holy Peaks surrounding Ulaan Bataar offer challenging hiking and breathtaking views. Manzshir Khiid Route on the Tsetseegum peak's southern side is the easiest route up; Zaisan Route is the most scenic and most difficult. There's more hiking in Gurvansaikhan National Park, around the hills of Khovd, and in the Gobi Desert. Huge Khövsgöl Nuur lake is a nirvana for fishing and kayaking and there's some spelunking to be done in lakeshore caves. January and February are good months for skiing. Downhill and crosscountry ski tours leave from Ulaan Bataar. Relive Genghis Khan's glory days by grabbing a horse, camel or yak for a ride in and around Ulaan Baatar.
