 Off the Beaten Track  This small island - out in the harbor and easily seen from York Redoubt - makes a pleasant break from what passes as the hubbub of the city. There are beaches, picnic tables and guided walks, as well as a fort at the south end of the island and a teahouse serving basic snacks and seafood. The island is currently being made into a provincial park to protect it from the rising tide of tourism. Boats depart the Halifax dock area from June to mid-September or you can take a boat from Dartmouth.
