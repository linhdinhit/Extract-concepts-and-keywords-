 When to Go  Religious ceremonies attract hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Vatican, with Christmas and Easter being the best-attended feasts. Each Christmas, the Pope himself says Mass to the standing-room-only crowd. Unless you've got special business, however, the city virtually shuts down on religious holidays. Rome is at its best in spring (April-May) and autumn (October-November). During these seasons the scenery is beautiful, the temperatures are pleasant, and there are relatively few crowds. Try to avoid August, as this is the time that most Italians take their vacations, and many shops and businesses are closed as a result.     Events  Mass is said daily in the Vatican (not always by the Pope, of course). Details about the services are available from the tourist office in the Piazza. If he's at home, the Pope usually gives a public audience on Wednesday mornings. Permission to attend must be sought in advance, either from an office near the Basilica or in writing.
