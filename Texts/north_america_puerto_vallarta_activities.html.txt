 Activities  The waters of the bay are ideally suited to activities like water skiing, snorkelling, diving, windsurfing, sailing, parasailing, fishing and swimming, with a fair number of operators in Puerto Vallarta busily supplying equipment and organising tours. There are also regular cruises that circumnavigate the bay or will beach you at Yelapa and Playa de las Animas. Animal watching is another popular local activity, with dolphins and humpback whales receiving the most attention. Back on shore, horse-riding and trekking outfits can guide you from local beaches up along jungle trails and into the mountains, plus there are several golf courses and tennis courts for less-adventurous work-outs. If you want to exercise your tongue, take a Spanish language course.
