 Off the Beaten Track  Murano and Burano are the best-known and most-visited of the lagoon's islands, and both reward a wander into their quiet backstreets. Sleepy Murano has long been famed for its glass production - since the 10th century, in fact, when the secrets of the art were smuggled into Venice by merchants trading in the East. Once ensconced in Murano, the methods of the craft became such a well-guarded secret that it was considered treason for glassworkers to leave the city. You can still catch the odd glassworker in action in shops and factories around the island, but whether your opinion of the end result is 'beautiful' or 'grotesque' is a matter of taste. The Museo Vetrario is devoted to the art and history of glasswork, and there are some exquisite pieces on display. The island's architectural highlight is the Veneto-Byzantine Basilica di SS Maria e Donato, with its colonnaded apse and 12th-century mosaic pavement. Vaporetto No 12 takes you to Murano, Burano and Torcello.
