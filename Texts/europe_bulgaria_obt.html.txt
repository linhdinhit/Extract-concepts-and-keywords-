 Off the Beaten Track  Take a slow wander through the Rodopi Mountains, home to Bulgaria's most isolated and ethnically diverse communities. The landscape takes in spectacular gorges and steep rocky slopes which open onto tiered fields and pine forests. The traditions of Bulgaria's Slavs are strongest in the Rodopi, and it is here most of the Muslim population lives: ethnic Turks and Pomaks, whose ancestors converted during the rule of the Ottoman Empire. During the communist period a 20km (12mi) exclusion zone was enforced along Bulgaria's southern border, ensuring that the villagers in this region were isolated.  Many travellers only get as far south as Bachkovo Monastery, 30km (19mi) south of Plovdiv. Smolyan, a large logging town 70km (43mi) farther south, is a good base for visits to the surrounding area. The ski resort of Pamporovo, 16km (10mi) north-west, is popular with package tourists from Britain and Germany, but day-trippers are also welcome. Twenty km north-west of Smolyan is Shiroka L ka, a scenic village of stone houses, meandering goats and chatting villagers striking casual poses with pitchforks and donkeys. The village is renowned for its traditional music, with a week-long festival taking place in mid-April.
