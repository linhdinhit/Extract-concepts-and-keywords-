 Activities  Suriname exemplary system of national parks and nature reserves is superb (although the infrastructure is not). Visitors interested in visiting the reserves should contact Stinasu (the Foundation for Nature Preservation) in Paramaribo.  Standing atop the Voltzberg dome at sunrise is mind-bendingly spectaular and watching wildlife such as giant leatherback sea turtles lay their eggs is breathtaking.  Even parsimonious travelers should take advantage of guided trips to Suriname's rainforest and coastal reserves, to which access can otherwise be difficult. It is possible to travel up the rivers in small boats navigated by Maroons, and boats travel along the coast between assorted towns.
