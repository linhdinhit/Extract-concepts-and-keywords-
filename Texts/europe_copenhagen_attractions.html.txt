 Attractions  Funsters will want to head to Tivoli, the popular amusement park-cum-flower garden in the heart of the city. The famed park has been operating for over 150 years and so has had plenty of time to figure out how to best cater to the hordes of tourists and locals, many trailing enthusiastic youngsters, who flock there between mid-April and late-September each year. There are all the usual fun-park attractions, such as a roller coaster, Ferris wheel, open-air performances, carnival games and food pavilions. For the more cultured fun-loving palates, there are also traditional folk dances and a large concert hall hosting international symphony orchestras and ballet troupes. Tivoli also opens up for a few weeks prior to Christmas for holiday festivities, a seasonal market and ice-skating on the lake.  When you've had all the gee-whiz, whoop-it-up, wallet-emptying festivities you can stomach, stagger out to the northern corner of the Tivoli compound and proceed in a calmer consumer-oriented manner up the world's longest pedestrian mall, Strøget. Strøget is a long chain of five streets that is replete with shops and eateries, as well as a myriad of entertainment options, including street theatre.
