 Attractions  Built around 1450 and continuously inhabited ever since, Taos Pueblo is the largest existing multistoried pueblo structure in the USA and one of the best surviving examples of traditional adobe construction. An informal tour, ranging from 15 to 40 minutes depending on who is giving it, is offered daily (no fee, but you should tip the guide).  Taos Pueblo plays host to a wide range of cultural events through the year. If you're in the area in early January, don't miss the Native American dances. In February, March and August, Taos Pueblo may be closed for sacred ceremonial dances. You must pay a fee to photograph, videotape, sketch or paint the pueblo. Taos Pueblo is located in the Taos Pueblo Indian Reservation, a couple of miles northeast of town.
