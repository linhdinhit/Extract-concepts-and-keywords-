 Activities  Albania's beaches are gorgeous, and you could spend a month travelling the Adriatic and Ionian coasts hopping from one stunning, sun-soaked spot to another. Inland, hiking is a possibility through forests and farmland, although you should stock up on hiking provisions before you leave the larger towns. The many mountains and cliffs offer opportunities for climbing, although climbing supplies are limited in Albania. The coast and central plains are ideal for cycling, as long as you can negotiate a route through the poorly maintained roads.
