 When to Go  Don't come to Nice in July or August if you dislike strong heat, crowds of holidaymakers and serious traffic jams. May and June are the most pleasant months, followed by September and October. Partygoers will enjoy the carnival in February.  With over 2500 hours of sunshine every year, Nice boasts an exceptionally mild climate. The average daily temperature hovers around 15 C/59 F, soaring up to 40 C/104 F in July-August and rarely dipping below 5 C/41 F in winter (November-February). In summer the water temperature is a languid 20-25 C (68-77 F).     Events  Nice has plenty of events and festivals year-round but several stand out. The two-week Nice Carnival in February celebrates Mardi Gras in a blaze of colourful floats and masked parades. In July the main venue for the Nice Jazz Festival is an attractive old olive grove in Cimiez. Also in July are the Nuits Musicales de Nice, three weeks of open-air, classical music concerts in the cloisters of Cimiez Monastery. During the musical season (October-June), the Opera de Nice stages ballets, recitals and operas. September sees Nice get sporty with the Triathlon de Nice, an international event involving swimming in the baie des Anges, cycling through the hills behind the city, and sprinting down the promenade des Anglais - easy!
