 Off the Beaten Track  Belfast is ringed by hills, visible from many points in the city, but none loom so large as Cave Hill (355m/1165ft). It's the best place to get your bearings and drink in some views - on a clear day you can even see Scotland lurking on the horizon. The Country Park sprawls over 300 hectares (740 acres) reaching down to Belfast Lough and is littered with ringforts, evidence of Iron Age occupation. Wolfe Tone and his United Irishmen gathered at the suitably dramatic McArt's Fort in 1795 to pledge to continue their struggle for Irish independence. Five artificial caves dating from the Neolithic era are nearby, and further down the slopes there's Belfast Castle, a Scottish Baronial confection dating from 1870 that's the venue for many a fashionable Belfast wedding. Below Cave Hill, Belfast Zoo has splendid views over Belfast Lough and as zoos go its enclosures are pretty good, in particular the sealion and penguin pools.
