 Environment  At the southern end of the African continent's western bulge, Togo sits on the Gulf of Guinea, surrounded by Burkina Faso to the north, Benin to the east and Ghana to the west. A bit smaller than the US state of West Virginia and twice the size of Belgium, Togo's a long, skinny strip of land, nearly five times as long (540km/335mi) as it is wide (110km/70mi). From the sandy lagoons along its 55km (35mi) of coastline, the country rises northward to rolling hills and plateaus covered in deciduous forest.  Central Togo is the location of the country's major national park, the For t de Fazao; the Parc National de la Keran is farther north, near Kara. The hills around Kpalime are excellent for growing coffee, while those around Atakpame serve better for their views.  Some of the animals you might see (though their numbers are few) are hippo, giraffe, waterbuck, duiker, oribi, buffalo, bush pig, wart hog, hyena, vervet, baboon and, if you're lucky, perhaps an elephant or lion. Bird species include stork, crane and marabou. Togo's not exactly rich with protected areas, and the years have not been kind to its animal population.  From December to January, the dusty, dry harmattan wind blows down from the deserts to the north. Togo's rainy season lasts from April to July, though short periods of rain are common in October and November. The country's hottest period is mid-February through mid-April.
