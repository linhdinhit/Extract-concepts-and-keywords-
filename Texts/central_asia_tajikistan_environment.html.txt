 Environment  At 143,100 sq km (55,800 sq mi), landlocked Tajikistan is Central Asia's smallest republic. More than half of it lies 3000m (9840ft) or more above sea level. The central part encompasses the southern reaches of the Tian Shan range while the south-east is raised high up in the Pamirs. Within these ranges are some of Central Asia's highest peaks, including Pik Lenina (7134m/23,400ft) and Pik Kommunizma (7495m/24,580ft). The western third of the country is lowland plain, bisected by two narrow ranges. Two rivers, the Amu-Darya and the Pyanj, mark most of the country's 1200km (740mi) border with Afghanistan. Tajikistan's other borders are much less well-defined: In the east the 430km (266mi) border with China meanders through Pamir valleys, while to the north and west are the equally random-seeming borders with Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.  Tajikistan's mountains are the setting for high, grassy meadows worthy of The Sound of Music. In summertime the wildflowers (including wild irises and edelweiss) are a riot of colour and trout lurk in the rushing streams. Marmots and pikas provide food for eagles and lammergeiers; the elusive snow leopard preys on the ibex, with which it shares a preference for crags and rocky slopes. Forests of Tian Shan spruce, larch and juniper provide cover for lynx, wolf, wild boar and brown bear.  Lowland Tajikistan veers between extrememly hot summers (an average maximum of 42 C/108 F in July) and extremely chilly winters (an average minimum of -12 C/10 F in January). From October through May, fierce snowstorms rage in the mountains and the temperature can drop to -45 C (-49 F), making getting around almost impossible. On the plains, strong duststorms can be expected from June through October. These winds can last for five days or more. After the storm passes, it can take as long as 10 days for the dust to settle.
