 Activities  If you feel like a paddle on the water, hire a boat for an hour or two and go boating on the Serpentine in Hyde Park. If faster water sports are your style, Docklands has jetskiing, waterskiing and windsurfing. London's parks - especially Hyde Park and Regents Park - are delightful for walking. There are also bike-hire joints all over the city for cyclists, although if you're planning to ride in traffic you might be taking your life in your hands. You can even hire a gee-gee and go horse riding if you're keen for a canter. Inline skaters should head to Hyde Park. And of course, London is littered with gyms, sports centres and even climbing walls. North of the centre, Highgate Ponds on Hampstead Heath offer open-air swimming all year round. Otherwise, take a dip in Ironmonger Row Baths or the Art Deco Porchester Spa.
