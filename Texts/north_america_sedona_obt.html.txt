 Off the Beaten Track  Montezuma Castle is an Ancestral Puebloan site built and occupied between the 12th and 14th centuries. The name refers to the splendid castle-like location high on a cliff; early explorers thought the five-story-high pueblo was Aztec and hence dubbed it Montezuma. A museum interprets the archaeology of this well-preserved site, visible from a self-guiding, wheelchair-accessible trail. Entrance into the 'castle' itself is prohibited. Access the monument from I-17 exit 289, then follow signs for 2mi(3km).  Montezuma Well, 10mi (16km) northeast of the castle, is also part of the monument. It's a natural limestone sinkhole, 470ft (140m) across and surrounded by remnants of Sinaguan and Hohokam dwellings. Water from the sinkhole is still used for irrigation by Native Americans. Both areas have picnic sites.
