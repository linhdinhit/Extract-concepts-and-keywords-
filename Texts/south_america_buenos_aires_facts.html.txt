 When to Go  Spring (September to November) and autumn (March to May) have the most hospitable temperatures, while the oppressive summer is a good time to head for the coastal resorts. Some museums and entertainment venues close during the hottest period. Summer is the most expensive time to visit with many holidaying porten s vying for accommodation and transport.     Events  The Feria del Libro annual book fair draws in over a million book fans to Buenos Aires during April, with Latin American literature most widely represented. The event takes place at the sprawling Centro Municipal de Exposicions. In mid-May, the Feria de Galer as de Arte features exhibitions from over 80 different galleries and showcases a variety of influences from Argentina and around the world.  Buenos Aires is famous for its tango heritage, and on December 11 each year locals celebrate D a del Tango, the birthday of Carlos Gardel, who took tango to the world. Many events take place around the city to mark the occasion and the singer's tomb at Chacarita draws Elvis-like worshipping hordes. For those interested in Argentina's traditional gaucho (cowboy) heritage, the Campeonato Abierto de Pato in December is the championship play-off for the pato crown; it's a bit like watching a game of horseback rugby. Also in December is the Campeonato Abierto Argentino de Polo, the slightly more highbrow polo championship season finale.
