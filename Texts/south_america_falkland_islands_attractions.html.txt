 Attractions  In reality, the Falkland Islands' capital is little more than a village that, by historical accident, acquired a political status totally out of proportion to its size. As many of its homes and businesses were pieced together from locally quarried stone and timber salvaged from shipwrecks, Stanley has a certain ramshackle charm, accentuated by its brightly painted houses, sprawling kitchen gardens and the smell of peat fires drifting on the breeze.  Probably the town's most photographed landmark, Government House has been the home of the islands' London-appointed governors since the mid-19th century. Just outside the building, there's a register of visitors that tradition insists you sign. Nearby, Christ Church Cathedral is a massive brick-and-stone construction with a colorfully painted metal roof and impressive stained-glass windows. It was completed in 1892 and now houses several plaques honoring the Falklands' war dead. On the small square next to the cathedral, look for the recently restored Whalebone Arch, commemorating the 1933 centenary of British rule in the Falklands. At the far western end of town, the Falkland Islands Museum is the local candle-burner for the islands' history.
