 Activities  The beaches of the Atlantic coast resorts are safe for swimming and get better the farther south you go. All of the major hotels have swimming pools and rent equipment for water sports such as sailboarding, water skiing and kneeboarding. Fishing excursions can be arranged in Banjul.   Cycling is not only good exercise, but it can be a great way to get around and tour Gambia. Bikes are available for rent - anything from a lightweight mountain bike to an ancient, single-gear, sit-up-and-beg roadster - in many tourist areas.   Football (soccer) is Africa's most popular game, and informal pick-up matches can be found in just about any town or village. Foreigners are usually warmly welcomed, and joining a game may be one of the best ways to meet the locals. If you bring along your own ball (which could be deflated for travelling), you'll be the hit of the day. Wrestling is also very popular, with a sort of anything-goes mentality making the sport that much more exciting. Matches are held year round.  Even amateur ornithologists will delight in the bird-watching possibilities to be had in The Gambia. Your best bet is to head to one of the country's national parks or reserves in the early morning or late afternoon. Migratory birds make the rounds between October and April.
