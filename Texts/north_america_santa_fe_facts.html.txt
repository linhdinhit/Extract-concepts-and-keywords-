 When to Go   Summer is the high season, coinciding with school vacations in both North America and Europe. Memorial Day weekend (end of May) to Labor Day weekend (beginning of September) is the vacation season; expect higher prices and more crowds. Plan well ahead if you're coming for the third weekend in August (Indian Market) - most hotel rooms are booked months in advance.   Santa Fe's ski season usually runs from Thanksgiving to Easter.     Events  The Indian Market, on the third weekend in August, is Santa Fe's biggest event. More than a thousand Indian artists from around the country show their works in booths on and around the plaza. This is a judged show and the quality of the work presented is phenomenal.  On the first weekend after Labor Day, the drunken, revelrous Santa Fe Fiesta commemorates Don Diego de Vargas' reconquering of the city in 1692. The highlight of the weekend is the burning of Zozobra (Old Man Gloom), a 40ft(12m)-high papier-m che doll. The destruction of Zozobra symbolizes the end of last year's problems. Food booths are set up on the plaza and music continues well into the night.  The Artist and Craftsman Show is held at one of eight different pueblos each summer and includes all kinds of food, dances and music as well as craft. The Rodeo of Santa Fe is a four-day regional rodeo held over the second weekend of July.
