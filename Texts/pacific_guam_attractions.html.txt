 Attractions  The city of Hagat a (formerly known as Aga a) has been the centre of Guam ever since the Spanish first set about remodelling the island on behalf of God. The town is small enough to explore on foot in an afternoon and there are plenty of parks and historic buildings. Central Hagat a features the remains of Casa Gobierno, the Governor's Palace, which dates back to 1736.  Don't miss the revolving statue of Pope John Paul II, on the site where the man himself held mass in 1981. The twirling pontiff certainly beats the miniature Statue of Liberty in Paseo de Susana Park to the north. In the south-east of the park, a statue of Chief Quipuha stands forever condemned to survey the congested traffic of Hagat a's main thoroughfare, Marine Drive. Quipuha donated the land for Guam's first Catholic church, the site of the present Dulce Nombre de Maria Cathedral in the town centre of Plaza de Espa a. Next door is Latte Park, named after the mysterious stone pillars, or lattes, moved here from an ancient Chamorro village. Dating back to 500 AD, the pillars are thought to have been the foundations for some very impressive native homes.
