 Off the Beaten Track  The tall art deco tower on the west side of Paseo de la Reforma opposite Avenida Ju rez is the headquarters of a Mexican passion: the Loter a Nacional (National Lottery). Each ticket purchased is for a particular draw ( sorteo) on a specific date, with prizes ranging from around US$600 to more than US$3 million. All sorts of calculations, hunches and superstitions are often called upon to decide which numbers may be lucky. Regular zodiaco draws, in which each ticket bears a sign of the zodiac as well as a number, adds more spice to the procedures. Take a seat in the cozy auditorium upstairs, and at exactly 8pm the ceremony begins. Cylindrical cages spew out numbered wooden balls, which are plucked out by uniformed pages who announce the winning numbers and their respective monetary winnings. You can buy a ticket of your very own at a street vendor or kiosk, and start dreaming of an early retirement in Mexico, a lifelong trip around the world, or at the very least, a lifetime supply of Bohemia lager.
