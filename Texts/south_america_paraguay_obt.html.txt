 Off the Beaten Track  During the War of the Triple Alliance, the village of Piribebuy, east of Asunci n, served as the national capital. Today it is a quiet backwater, notable only for an excellent church, a strong local drink called ca a, and an interesting museum that is opened on request by a Chaco War veteran. Wounded three times by Bolivian bullets, the man will gingerly take you around a number of deteriorating exhibitions - then lead you to his own bloodied and torn uniform on display.
