 Attractions  Before the country's political troubles of the 1990s, Lome was the pearl of West Africa. Nearly everyone who swept through the region stopped in Lome for a few days at the beach. French and German tourists, especially, would flock in during the winter, living it up in the city's five-star hotels and fine restaurants. But travellers are fairly scarce these days, and many businesses are just getting by. Though a few hotels still do a brisk business, most tourist facilities now bide their time in a semi-deserted ambience. There are a few Internet cafes opening up in Lome with cheap and reliable connections. It's the only place in Togo you'll find public access to the Internet.  On the Place de l'Independence stands a gilded bronze statue of the man behind the muscle, President Eyadema, and another of his mother; both were removed during the civil disturbances of 1991. The Palais des Congres was previously the headquarters of Eyadema's party. Behind the Palais, the National Museum houses a collection of historical artefacts, pottery and woodcarvings.  For a livelier tour, the Grand Marche in the town centre is a three-storey hive of buying and selling. Inside, you'll find everything from modern manufactured goods to traditional African foods, arts and textiles. For batiks, wooden sculptures and leather work, the best place to look is the quiet Village Artisanal, where you can ogle the artists at work. There are also artisan stalls near the H tel du Golfe, but be prepared to fend off the touts if you drop by.  The Marche des Feticheurs, 8km (5mi) west of the centre, has a somewhat spookier collection, including potions, dried animal organs and other items used in traditional medicine. It's become something of a tourist trap, but it's still worth a look.
