 Attractions  St John's is Antigua's capital and commercial center, home to 30,000 people - over a third of the country's population. It's also the island's tourist center, but most of the city remains unaffected by international influence, remaining solidly West Indian in flavor. St John's tourist activity is confined to the harborfront complexes of Heritage Quay, a favorite with cruise ship passengers, and the more rustic Redcliffe Quay, where shops, restaurants and galleries inhabit restored stone buildings and wooden huts.
