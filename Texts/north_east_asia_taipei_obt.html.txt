 Off the Beaten Track  The Yangmingshan mountain range at the northern end of Taipei provides a scenic alternative to the bustle of the city centre. Springtime sees blossoming cherry trees and azaleas. The lower slopes are home to wealthy Taiwanese and westerners who prefer the cooler, clean air. These areas are also home to ultra-expensive US-style housing projects, but most of the mountain is protected from such development and still remains a great place for hiking day-trips. There is a restaurant in the park that is practically impossible to get a booking at and a few thermal areas, including a hot-springs resort. Camping is possible in the area - as is hotel accommodation - but most just go for a couple of lungs full of fresh air.
