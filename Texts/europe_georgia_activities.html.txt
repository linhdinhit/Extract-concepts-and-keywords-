 Activities  Although not particularly well organised from a traveller's perspective, the mountains of north and south Georgia are prime hiking country. Best attempted in the summer months is a four-day walk from Kazbegi to Khevsureti in the north. A guide is strongly recommended - there are many villages along the way and the wild locals sometimes require an introduction. The nights will be cold, so rug up.  With its Soviet health spa reputation, you'd imagine swimming at Georgian beaches would be world class. Unfortunately, the best beaches are in the northwest, which means Abkhazia. What with landmines and lawlessness throughout this region, if you're desperate for a really good beach, you should maybe try Hawaii. On the southern coast of the Black Sea, however, resorts with pebble beaches can still be found and remain popular with locals.   Wine tastings are increasing in popularity throughout the country, and especially in the east, where there seems to be a winery around every corner. Get someone else to do the driving.
