 Off the Beaten Track  Stretching both east and west of Plateia Monastirakiou, the flea market is Athens at its noisiest, most colourful and chaotic. Although not what it used to be, it still has a distinctly festive atmosphere and is a must-see for visitors. It teems with shops, restaurants and cafes, and street vendors selling nuts, coconut sticks, fruit, treasure, trash and more. Visit on Sunday morning, when the market is especially lively with all manner of things up for grabs. There's everything from clocks to condoms, trombones to gramophones, tyres to telephones, giant evil eyes to jelly-baby clones. It's the place to test your haggling skills.
