 When to Go  While there's really no bad time to visit Thailand's capital, rain and extreme heat are less frequent between November and February. In Bangkok, April is only recommended to those with portable air conditioners, while October brings the heaviest rains - these are probably the best times to be out of Thailand. The tourists flock to Bangkok in December and August, while the least crowded months tend to be May, June and September.     Events  With so many cultures and beliefs colliding in Bangkok, it's rare to be in town and not run into a festival of some description. This is especially true in the cooler months from November to February, but religious and cultural events occur year-round. Coronation Day is on 5 May and those in Bangkok at the time can get a glimpse of the royals at Wat Phra Kaew. Also celebrated with some fervour in Bangkok is the King's Birthday on 5 December - some residents erect temporary shrines outside their houses or businesses.  On the cultural side of things, May sees the Royal Ploughing Ceremony halt traffic around Sanam Luang - this ancient Brahman ritual marks the official opening of the rice-planting season. The Thailand International Swan-Boat Races take place in Bangkok in September, and see colour and crowds flocking to the Rama IX Bridge over the Chao Phraya River.
