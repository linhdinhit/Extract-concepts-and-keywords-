 Off the Beaten Track  Sandy Island, lying a mile (1.6km) off Sandy Ground, is a small islet consisting of little more than some fine sand and a couple of coconut palms - you can walk around the whole thing in just 10 minutes. The island is surrounded by shallow reefs that offer reasonable snorkeling, with waving finger corals, sea fans and small tropical fish. You can arrange the five-minute boat ride to the islet at Sandy Ground.
