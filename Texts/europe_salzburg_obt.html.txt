 Off the Beaten Track  The picturesque town of Werfen provide access to one of the area's top attractions, the Eisriesenwelt ice caves. These caves, at an elevation of 1640m (5380ft), are the largest accessible ice caves in the world and were first entered in 1870. The mighty entrance to the caves, measuring 20m (66ft) wide by 18m (59ft) high, can be seen from afar. The caves contain about 30,000 cubic metres of ice and about 42km (26m) of passages have been explored. Entry is only possible with an authorized guide and the 75-minute tour, which visits only about one-fiftieth of the caves, takes in several immense caverns containing elaborate ice formations and frozen waterfalls.  Illumination is via lamps while powerful, albeit brief, magnesium flares provide additional highlighting. Wear warm clothing and heavy shoes as the temperature in the caves is usually below freezing even in summer. The caves are open between May and early October and are located near Werfen. You can get to Werfen by train (50 minutes) from Salzburg or via Hwy 10. Allow 3-4 hours for the whole visit, which includes getting to the caves from Werfen.
